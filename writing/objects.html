		<h1>Meaningful Objects</h1>
		<p>I&rsquo;ve always been someone fascinated by objects that represent past meaning. I think that&rsquo;s a part of what makes us human&mdash;assigning sacred, almost religious value to random knickknacks that appear meaningless to another person. Of course, there&rsquo;s about packrats who live in attics full of Kennedy assassination newspapers, but I&rsquo;m talking about something a bit more selective. Not keeping things for the sake of keeping things&mdash;rather, keeping things to harbor a memory that would otherwise be clouded or covered up. It&rsquo;s almost as if the object in question is a Horcrux&mdash;but instead of holding a part of Voldemort&rsquo;s soul, it contains a mental image of an experience that would otherwise be long forgotten.</p>
		<p> The best thing about these types of Horcruxes is that they are often not intentionally saved. The stuff I think that would be greet to keep, like old essays and vinyl records, might have great meaning to me, but at some point I made the conscious decision to keep them. Their memories are well-defined, their preservation meticulously planned. While these items will definitely mean something in the future, they are not special yet because they do not reside in the periphery of my mind. To point it bluntly, they are too &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; and the memories they invoke are too novel to be of nostalgic value.</p>
		<p> However, a misplaced item dating from a previous experience that was not intentionally saved&mdash;that is something special. Most of the time, this misplaced items do not have the power to invoke a past experience, simply because they do not have any special indicators to jog a specific memory. For example, if I saved a Cheetos bag from when my child gave birth, but the bag was so insignificant that I did not remember I ate it while I was staring into the dark abyss of my wife&rsquo;s vagina, when I find it 10 years later it&rsquo;s probably not going to remind me of the event. I&rsquo;m just going to grimace at a random Cheetos bag, and toss it without eve realizing it satisfied me while my child was being born.</p>
		<p> So an item being unintentionally saved is not enough. Rather, the item must be preserved and possess an indicator of its past significance. Here&rsquo;s a great example. I was emptying my college backpack today (this kind of fits in the category&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t intentionally saved, and it certainly is memorable enough to have achieved significance), and in the backpack I found a piece of paper. The piece of paper was preserved because it was tucked away in a compartment that I probably used only a few times over the course of the thousands of times I stored crap in the backpack. Anything shoved in that compartment was going to last a great while. So the piece of paper definitely satisfied requirement one. But even more special&mdash;on the piece of paper was the address of my bombed-out apartment in Los Angeles, where I spent a very jarring summer. Just seeing this ratty, disgustingly browned listing of my old apartment was enough to convince me it had to be shredded immediately. But just the fact that it survived in such an unlikely matter, and contained a blunt reminder of a very intense experience, was enough to give the memory section of my brain a chemical orgasm. And while the brought back some intense experiences, it also allowed me to relive moments entirely different than if I just would have stopped and &ldquo;thought&rdquo; about it. It&rsquo;s like seeing something made me visually associate an object with an experience in a way that allowed me to transcend the present and relive a moment in time.</p>
		<p>Try it sometime. Well, it&rsquo;s not something one can really control. It&rsquo;s more of a stumble-upon moment. But when it happens, you&rsquo;ll know.</p>
