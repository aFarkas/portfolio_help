		<h1>Comparing Myself to Celebrities</h1>
		<p> American celebrity culture is something I&rsquo;ve noticed a lot more recently. When I was younger, celebrities were just people I enjoyed in movies and made for decently attractive magazine covers at the supermarket. In short, I didn&rsquo;t care about them beyond the media they occupied.</p>
		<p> But then something happened. I realized they were actually people with life histories and brains, just like me! And even worse, I noticed many of them did the things I like doing with my life&mdash;not wearing sunglasses and posing at photo shoots, but rather more creative things, like writing, playing music, and being involved with movies and YouTube.</p>
		<p>So naturally, I started to get to know them in the &ldquo;You are in the public image and I experience a lot of your public personality, and I thus fake believe you are my friend&rdquo; sense of the world. But I think the best celebrities make for the most relatable ones&mdash;or at least the ones who are most adept at exporting their personality in a way that makes people care about them. If a celebrity&rsquo;s &ldquo;public personality&rdquo; is glassy and fake, America isn&rsquo;t going to give a shit. But if the celebrity somehow shows us they experience the trials and tribulations of ordinary folk, if they can crack poop jokes with the best of them while opening up about a serious drug problem, we might want to consider taking them into our heart. And while we can&rsquo;t experience the ordinary pleasures of friendship like dinner and drinks, we might have to settle for opening up our wallets and splurging a little to see them in their latest movie. Or have VIP access to their porn website. Hey, there&rsquo;s all types of celebrities with days, and with that diversity, comes a variety of ways we can get to know our new friends.</p>
		<p>But this isn&rsquo;t the stuff that has bothered me. The thing has bothered me is a social syndrome of sorts, probably written about by hundreds of millennial Huffington Post guest writers around the world. I&rsquo;m talking about comparing oneself to celebrities.</p>
		<p>That&rsquo;s right, Aziz Ansari. I&rsquo;m looking at you, you deliciously relatable, socially awkward, bearded Indian. We all see a little bit of ourselves in you&mdash;especially the way in which you analyze your nephew&rsquo;s quirky tendencies! Yes, I realize that writing about the ways in which a celebrity is relatable is ironically the least effective way to illustrate how they are so likable. But the fact is, sometimes I find that I compare myself to them&mdash;which almost always ends in defeat for me, as they are outliers at the top of their creative fields. Point is, I&rsquo;m joking here, but I am still young and haven&rsquo;t realized my fullest potential, but I&rsquo;m putting myself on a pedestal with perfect strangers who have done shit that most of us probably won&rsquo;t accomplish in our lifetimes. </p>
		<p>But then I think to myself&mdash;no one has ever gotten anymore by constantly comparing themselves to celebrities that have achieved similar things before them. Of course, everyone has their influences and idols, but for a person to contribute, they have to have their own ideas. Right? They have to possess some kernel of originality and &ldquo;voice&rdquo; that makes them palatable to perfect strangers. In short, I realize that &lsquo;being yourself&rsquo; really is the perfect antidote to the suffocating tide of celebrity culture that washes us away in another person&rsquo;s personality. Everyone has an act of sorts&mdash;and probably the most tired one is imitating another person&rsquo;s to the point where you have nothing novel to bring to the table. So as much as Aziz Ansari wants me to buy his book and watch his new Netflix series, I realize that&rsquo;s only because he wants to promote his own brand. Of course he is proud of the things he made and wants to share them with the world, but I&rsquo;m not going to get any better at being myself if I just consume things made by others all day. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s bad to enjoy things made by others&mdash;in fact, that&rsquo;s often how a person learns to craft the things that mean the most to them. But I think the idea that most often gets lost is the crafting itself&mdash;i.e. talking the time to actually make something yourself, write something, and take pride in your viewpoints and ability to create. No one ever wrote a book by reading a hundred great novels without ever putting pen to paper.</p>
