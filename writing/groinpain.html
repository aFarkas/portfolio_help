		<h1>Groin Pain</h1>
		<p>&lt;p&gt;For better or worse, I am a person who suffers from chronic ailments. Most of them are not very serious. It&amp;rsquo;s those nagging pains that are a real nag.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s hard to categorize a serious illness as a &amp;ldquo;nag&amp;rdquo;. To me, a nag is something that gets on your nerves, an understudy that wants to get into the mainstage production of your life, except it doesn&amp;rsquo;t ever remember its lines. It has no business making a nuisance of itself&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s not like it&amp;rsquo;s cancer or even a wisdom tooth extraction. And the king of these nagging injuries for me is most definitely groin pain.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt; Whomever named a part of the body &amp;ldquo;the groin&amp;rdquo; did humanity a real disservice. Is a groin even a body part, or just an inconveniently placed tunnel between the penis and stomach? It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t even really be an embarrassing area, but its proximity to the penis makes it a very awkward area to inspect, especially in the doctor&amp;rsquo;s office. There&amp;rsquo;s no way one can go down there without removing pants and pushing underwear down just enough to where it gets embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt; I have a good habit of straining my groin at the gym. I was introduced to a few exercises to strengthen my core. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know a core was a part of the body either, until I was introduced to some vintage Jane Fonda exercise videos. I think a core is something Chief Justice Potter Stewart would appreciate&amp;mdash;you know it when you see it&amp;rdquo; If you see a tight, 45-year-old Jane Fonda on an old VHS tape performing exercises that make her stomach tighter than a piece of premium-aged string cheese, she must be doing something that works. I think the problem with cores is that they are hidden under what most people call &amp;ldquo;bellies.&amp;rdquo; But I&amp;rsquo;d much rather have a core then a belly, which is way I made the horribly painful choice to start working out.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt; There&amp;rsquo;s this one bench at the gym that is tilted 45 degrees relative to the floor, so you feel strapped into a spaceship as you are laying on it. Naturally, the way you us this bench is to counteract the forces of gravity and bend your body across itself. The first time I tried this exercise, I could not even do eight reps. Since then, I have gotten so good at bending that I can actually hold dumbbells and do an entire set of eight reps.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;I was getting to be a show-off, as most athletes are. I was completing the set with ease, steadily increasing the weight each time. I just &amp;lsquo;happened&amp;rsquo; to be holding a 20 lb. medicine ball, and without even batting an eye, I began to pull myself up. One rep turned into three, which eventually turned into eight. And you better bet your bottom dollar that I was hurting.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt; The nag thing about groin pain, or any other pain while exercising for that matter, is that there is a fine line between &amp;ldquo;hurt so good&amp;rdquo; pain and &amp;ldquo;hurt my wallet so good because I have a large co-pay to give the orthopedist.&amp;rdquo; There&amp;rsquo;s really no way to get fit without work and tearing your muscles, but there&amp;rsquo;s definitely a threshold. And this is why the groin pain occurs.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt; I admit it. I was a pompous, buff showoff. My bubble-wrap abs and super strong groin got ballsy and wanted to push the limit. But there&amp;rsquo;s always a catch. There&amp;rsquo;s always a catch.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;If groin pain was a mediocre street rapper with 57 cents to his name, he&amp;rsquo;d be spouting that rhyme from Brooklyn to physical therapy. I guess the only answer is to let the boombox of pain play out until it gets outmoded. Only then might we be able to move onto another body-part affiliated genre of music. I just hope it isn&amp;rsquo;t tennis elbow dubstep. That might be even worse.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
