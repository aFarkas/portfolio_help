		<h1>A Short History of the New York Mets</h1>
		<p>The New York Mets are definitely the boiled pastrami sandwich of baseball teams. They certainly do not evoke the passionate, evocative displays of love and hate that you expect from teams like the Yankees, the Red Sox and the Cubs. The prime cuts, shall we say. Rather, there&#39;s nothing else better to compete with on the NL East menu, so you go with it. And after you&#39;re done, and you&#39;re asked to rate the experience, you deliver a passionate, Jerry-Seinfeld influenced, &#39;Ehh&#39;?</p>
		<p>But, this year could be different. The Mets have delivered a convincing shellacking to every team in their division, and are arguably responsible for the firing of Nationals coach Matt Williams.  (Update: The Mets got killed in the World Series. But in the world of sports, one must look at championship losses as a progression. Unless you are the New England Patriots.)</p>
		<p>But perhaps the golden indicator of the Mets&#39; future success is the past.</p>
		<h2>Founding</h2>
		<p>By 1962, there was only one thou-who-shall-not-be-named, baseball team in New York (Yankees), as the other two had jumped on the bandwagon for greener pastures (California). William Shea, the latest in a long line of attorneys looking to switch professions, was looking to found a baseball team for the beginning of baseball&#39;s expansion era. And as it always is, the most challenging part of the ordeal was picking a name. Shea really wanted the team to be called the Meadowlarks, (and thank god he lost). People settled on the Mets, in part because it could be easily printed in a newspaper. The Mets were always a forward-thinking organization. </p>
		<h2>1969</h2>
		<p>The Mets pretty much sucked throughout the 60&#39;s. They even had their own nickname: the lovable losers! This pretty much continued until they drafted a popular USC pitcher named Tom Seaver, one of the first Mets who did not find losing lovable. The Mets picked him out of a hat, but still managed to screw up the &#39;69 season, going 21-23 until the month of May. The Cubs were poised to win the National League East, but if there&#39;s one team that chokes harder than the Mets, it&#39;s definitely the Cubs. By mid-August, the Mets were 10 games back to the Cubs, however, the Mets managed to win 38 of their last 45 games, which is basically baseball&#39;s version of the immaculate conception. Even after Tom Seaver went 25-7, performed 10 virgin births, and won the lottery every day for a year, the news media still picked the Mets going to lose in the playoffs, because sportswriters always make great predictions. The Miracle Mets shut down the Braves and Orioles in the playoffs, and won the World Series!</p>
		<h2>Play Hard, Party Harder Era</h2>
		<p>With the exception of another almost miracle season in 1973 led by Tug McGraw, the Mets continued to suck it up through the 70&#39;s. The owner was eventually forced to sell the team to a publishing company, and thus began the Play Hard, Party Harder Era of the 1980&#39;s.The Mets progressively improved until 1986, when they dominated the whole year and made the World Series against the Red Sox, the only team at the time who choked harder than the Mets and Cubs. The Mets faced elimination in game six, until Boston pitcher Bob Stanley threw a wild pitch on a bases-loaded, 2-out pitch in the 10th inning, tying the game. What followed was one of the most famous and bizarre plays in baseball history.</p>
		<p>On a full count, Mets pitcher Mookie Wilson hit a easily fieldable dribbler to first, but Red Sox first baseman Bill Buckner missed it. The Mets won the game, and went on to win the Series.</p>
		<p>The Mets would finish up the late 80&#39;s with more good teams, but failed to win the Series. The Mets struggled throughout the 90&#39;s, until one catcher with a conspicuous amount of pimples on his back (steroids) would transform the Met&#39;s fate. Teammates such as Robin Ventura, Edgardo Alfronzo, and Derek Bell would carry the Mets to several good seasons, including a subway world series in 2000 against the Yankees, which ended in defeat. After 9/11, Shea was used as a relief center, and also played host to the first sporting event after the attacks, in which Mike Piazza delievered a colossal home run to win over the Braves. the Mets, as well as other teams in the league, wore Red Cross, FDNY, NYPD and PAPD hats. Unlike the other teams, the Mets wore these for the rest of the year, despite threats of fines by Major League Baseball.</p>
		<p>The Mets record in the 2000&#39;s was mixed, but mostly bad. Despite playing host to Mets all-time greats Carlos Beltran, Tom Glavine, and David Wright, the Mets have failed to win another crown. They made the playoffs in 2006, but lost to a very hot St.Louis team that still dominates baseball today. And who can forget the Mets in 2007, becoming the first team to blow a lead of seven or more games with only 17 games to play. I sure can&#39;t, because I&#39;m a Phillies fan. (/bias)</p>
