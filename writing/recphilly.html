		<h1><strong>How RECphilly is Revitalizing Philly&rsquo;s Music Scene</strong></h1>
		<h3><em>A new movement is unlocking Philly&rsquo;s music potential</em></h3>
		<p>Many musicians are moving from New York and other creative communities along the East Coast to Philadelphia. The city hosts a bustling creative community, and offers more affordable neighborhoods than other cities that were previously more hospitable to the creative lifestyle. <em>The Jawn</em>, a Philadelphia rock band, touts Philly as a premier creative destination for any aspiring musician. &ldquo;Philly is a hotbed of talent,&rdquo; they say. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big city and a lot of people flock here. Compared to New York, it&rsquo;s less expensive so a lot of artists are coming here and congregating. There is a lot of collaborative effort.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>While Philadelphia&rsquo;s creative population may be increasing, the city is often criticized for not having the infrastructure for artists to launch viable musical careers. <em>Patrick Donovan</em>, a Philadelphia songwriter who has experienced success, knows the importance of having the right team. A competent management team can provide musicians access to a vast support network that would not be accessible working alone.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The team had my back from day one,&rdquo; Donovan says. &ldquo;They are very good with keeping the artists up to date with what&rsquo;s going on, and promote different projects. It&rsquo;s been a great support network.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>RECphilly has assisted Patrick with organizing shows and making connections with important people in the local music industry. &ldquo;RECphilly is very collaborative,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about putting together the different pieces of the puzzle, and they do a very good job with that.&rdquo;</p>
		<p> Of note recently was the successful 30 For 30 series, an event that featured an arts and entertainment showcase each day during the month of April. The collaboration brought venue owners together with musicians, comedians, choreographers, and dancers to create an unprecedented month-long event of artistic expression.</p>
		<p>When asked about RECphilly&rsquo;s prospects for the future, Donovan is very optimistic. The campaign is currently working towards launching a new Philadelphia record label, RECollective Records, which will feature a slate of up-and-coming artists. Crowdfunding is also a big goal of the movement, as the group is planning to raise capital from the Philly music community at-large to establish more infrastructure to support local artists. &ldquo;In five years, RECphilly will be one of the biggest competing labels, at least on the East Coast,&rdquo; Donovan says. &ldquo;We have all the right people in line. Everything is really coming together just the way we hoped it would.&rdquo;</p>
