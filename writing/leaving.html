		<h1>How To Leave</h1>
		<p> It is a warm, late summer eve. You are being pummeled by the humid, sultry swells of a breeze suffering from seasonal identity disorder. Yes, the air is dripping with the wet humidity of the August dog days, but there also multicolored leaves interspersed in the madness, and little acorns that fall from the trees and hit your sweatshirt in a way that threatens to cramp your style. Your style&mdash;a maroon hoodie with that white thing you pull on that makes the hood tighter. It&rsquo;s like a snake, except it has those shoelace covers on the two ends of it. Yeah, it&rsquo;s basically a shoelace in a sweatshirt.</p>
		<p> The point is, that is your style, a hoodie and a pair of blue jeans that make you blend in with the crowd. You have not come for a lesson on contemporary American dress or a motherly figure to help you address your sweatshirt so the hoodie does not threaten to touch your bottom like the hair on a sexy model. No, you are here to blend in, to become an organism along with the thousands of other unstylishly dressed denizens. You are here to submit.</p>
		<p> It was about the same time last year when you heard he would first be coming. A figure of this magnitude, with followers easily numbering in the tens of millions, and the weight of several thousand years of spiritual tradition backing his cause. This is a man who at one time could cause science to bend to his every whim, could control the contents of every printed word on entire contents. This is a man who proclaimed that the world was flat; that the sun and all worldly bodies revolved around the earth; that God himself was the human incarnate of a single man. You could not understand why he had such a following over the course of several thousand years, after all in which he and those before him preached proved to be wrong or terribly out of touch. His organization&rsquo;s views on science were eventually objectively disproved. The tenets on marriage and family life eventually outmoded, even disobeyed to the very opposite of their original intended meaning. And yet this man has tens of millions of followers, and is revered almost everywhere in the world, even by those who would never dare adhere to his teachings. And you want to see this man, even though he represents all that you consider cruel and unjust?</p>
		<p> Well, maybe not all. There are still some fairly well intentioned tenets of basic human decency, and a notion that the poor, sick, and unprivileged of this world should be helped, instead of crushed into oblivion. But there&rsquo;s so much else&mdash;the intolerance, loyalty to ancient, obsolete customs, even unwillingness to preach in plain language&mdash;that you believe to be the very reason for so much confusion and violence in the world. And yet, you and the millions of other people still line up on this unseasonably warm day to watch him speak. And you remove your sweatshirt, not because it is unseasonably hot, but because you were hiding something underneath your jacket. This something is quite alarming to the thousands of police personnel surrounding you, but it is not a bomb. It is, simply, a choice. A choice to leave this place, to leave these millions of citizens coming to see this one man, a choice to look within yourself and ask the question, &ldquo;What does this man actually represent?&rdquo; And when you finally take that choice, and come upon an answer that satisfies you immensely, you realize that you don&rsquo;t have to listen to what other people have been saying about how to live your life. And so you leave. And by doing so, you do the very one thing that this man has come to prevent. You stop being a believer.</p>
