		<h1>Smallness and Bigness</h1>
		<p>I think humans think too much about the big inevitable nature of the universe and tend to ignore the small. I&rsquo;m talking about the crusty edges of a remote control that descend into oblivion&mdash;the microscopic annals of imperceptibility that even a bacterium would have trouble navigating.</p>
		<p> I have such an obsession with <em>crust</em>&mdash;the notion that small bits of waste can get stuck between things for years on end, without anybody noticing. Do people really realize that the spaces between their keyboard buttons have as much universe in them as an entire galaxy? That if I take half of a fraction and divide that quotient by another half, I can keep on going until I construct star-systems of atoms and quarks? Admittedly, I&rsquo;m not sure what the smallest unit of matter is&mdash;I read one of those &lsquo;popular science&rsquo; books by that dude in the wheelchair, and even his dumbed down explanations of subatomic particulars made my brain work very, very hard.</p>
		<p>I guess I&rsquo;m more interested in the psychological reasons why humans are obsessed with big and not small. Big egos, big sticks, big dicks&mdash;if one possesses a larger-than-life thing, they are bound to catch somebody&rsquo;s attention. But what about the power of smallness&mdash;staying in the moment, only biting off as much as you can chew, living within your means&mdash;when did these virtues transform from something to be strived for into something considered boring and unambitious? Is it really less exciting to think about the spaces in between your floorboards rather than the light-years in between star systems? Is being still in the present moment really less gratifying to think about than a magical, albeit distant and totally hypothetical future?</p>
		<p>Perhaps I am getting carried away. I started talking about dirt in a remote control and got lost on a tangent about obsessions with larger-than-life phenomena. I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that maybe it&rsquo;s fun and healthy to concentrate on the present smallness of life, rather than the hypothetical, distant bigness. After all, there&rsquo;s just as much space to explore within the notched confines of an armpit as long as one uses a very small, perceptive pair of tweezers. That has to be at least as fun as using a large telescope to explore a distant planet, no?</p>
