		<h1>Why I Want To Stop Stalking People Online</h1>
		<p>Sometimes I do this thing where I stalk people on the Internet. I know, it sounds like a fairly efficient use of my time. I&rsquo;m not sure why I have fallen into this habit&mdash;maybe it&rsquo;s something related to my tendency to Wikipedia everything I can get my hands on. I like to think I have a fairly accessible mental map of every single theme on Wikipedia, which makes me a fairly versatile person at weddings, even though I find it really tough to bullshit with people. Anyway, I think my tendency to research and Google has really developed into something that can take me over, especially when I fall into one of my &lsquo;swings&rsquo;.</p>
		<p>A &lsquo;swing&rsquo; is essentially what happens when I find someone I am interested in online. Before long, I have tracked every one of their social media pages, even their quasi-secret, totally embarrassing vines where they pretend to overdose on acetaminophen and make jokes about liver damage. And their LinkedIn page which suggests they are a marketing writer, even though you know they are a comedian and juggler. There&rsquo;s all kinds of crap online that clouds who a person really is, but unfortunately this is the only data that is accessible 24/7.</p>
		<p>Nevertheless, I think accessibility trumps the truth. I go on these benders where I literally click on every link that contains any single byte of data related to the name of the person I am investigating, to the point where I am able to produce a data tree of all their acquaintances, hangout spots, JPEGs of chicken cacciatore, etc. I see that they are living and at least appearing to do things, which sometimes gets me down, because while I am living in their shoes, I myself am doing nothing except Googling about strangers. And in this age of social media comparison, it always works out pretty crappy for me.</p>
		<p>I think this digital problem I am having really just highlights some basic irrational patterns of human socialization that have existed for thousands of years. The chief of these might be that humans unnecessarily compare themselves to each other. I&rsquo;m sure there is an evolutionary reason for this (namely attracting mates), but in the era of the Internet, all these indicators of comparison are presented in real-time, and can be instantly quantified. This makes it even harder to escape, especially for a guy who loves to dive headfirst into a search engine with nothing but a backspace button to slow him down.</p>
		<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s as if I am seeing what I wish I would be doing with my life exemplified in others. Other times I&rsquo;m feel as if I&rsquo;m trying to figure out who I am by comparing myself to other people who are more defined (Comedy is just the latest example of this.) But there is always one constant that I feel after I partake in this stalking behavior, and that is a great sadness. I am aware that I am happier when I stay in the means of my own life, and do things, rather than live vicariously through the Internet. Writing things like this diary make me happy&mdash;it is example of me doing something rather than thinking about doing it, and also lets me write about something. Maybe if I started presenting myself to others in an honest way like this, I would get more fulfillment than if I mindless followed others who were doing something with their lives.</p>
		<p>What I do know is there is a fine line on the Internet today between really lame self-promotion and presenting something that is really valuable to others. I find the best people online are those who I do not have to mindless stalk to get to know&mdash;those who put themselves out there with brutal honesty, in a way that doesn&rsquo;t seem contrived or scripted. The challenge with this is that most people aren&rsquo;t inherently interesting&mdash;it&rsquo;s much easier to snag YouTube views talking about a Justin Bieber concert than discussing your Gas-X stash or your gut&rsquo;s reaction to your mom&rsquo;s homemade toaster strudel. But building an audience is a skill I presume, and surely not one that comes easy to people.</p>
		<p>I definitely should stop letting other people&rsquo;s online presences get me down. It&rsquo;s not good to compare myself to others because I am me. I think that&rsquo;s the take-a-way of any stalking ritual.</p>
