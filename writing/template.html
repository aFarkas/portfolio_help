		<h1>A Short History of the New York Mets</h1>
		<p>I remember Brett Myers&rsquo; first start. It was back in 2003, when I was getting a Powerade out of the big overpriced cooler at summer camp. He was part of a pair of young Phillies pitching prospects that were supposed to turn the tide of years of mediocre pitching. Brett Myers and Joe Roa&mdash;the boys of summer that were going to save us all.</p>
		<p> Brett Myers was a tall, intimidating pitcher with a blazing fastball and a goatee you would find on a 1940&rsquo;s cartoon character. Joe Roa was just a guy who made it to the major leagues, and had embarrassing facial features. He also had mediocre stuff, which is why no one ever heard from him again.</p>
		<p> Myers was luckier in the career longevity department. His fastball was above average, he had a changeup that provided a nice change of pace, and he threw a curve that was mediocre at best. His first few seasons as a Phillie, he got by with the heater and established himself as the ace of the team. Then, in true baseball fashion, he was traded to the Astros, which was pretty much a death sentence after the early 2000&rsquo;s. But the real story begins when Myers was reacquired, just as the Phillies were making their playoff push in 2007.</p>
		<p> Brett still had the same cocky attitude and sufferin&rsquo; succotash mustache, but his fastball wasn&rsquo;t what it used to be. He tried to restablish his mojo in the rotation, even as a #4 guy (a young whippersnapper named Cole Hamels was gunning for the ace position), but his fastball farted out. The Phils moved him to the bullpen and tried to make him a closer, which worked for a little while before he started sucking again. Eventually Myers was benched and sent down to the minors. The Phillies patched in some weird pitchers by the name of Kyle Kendrick and Joe Blanton, who had career years at just the right time. But bad boy Brett wasn&rsquo;t done.</p>
		<p> It&rsquo;s worth noting that Myers was pissed he was demoted. He cursed out a reporter and almost got into a physical altercation, captured in a sound bite that was in sports talk replay hell by the next day (I&rsquo;m looking at you, Angelo Cataldi). But the Phillies were desperate&mdash;when Myers was good he could dominate, and their bullpen lacked a setup guy behind Brad Lidge. So they bought ol&rsquo; Brett back.</p>
		<p> He was somehow great again for the last third of the season. Brett&rsquo;s fastball took a time machine back to 2003 and his mouth didn&rsquo;t matter as long as he could throw strikes. Myers also enjoyed a hot bat, and pulled off some very impressive at-bats in the playoffs, including a <em>huge</em> walk by C.C. Sabathia (yes, I did use a very important baseball clich&eacute; to describe a walk, but it really was a big deal. Myers probably fouled off at least 10 pitches.) Also, Brett was particularly adept at spraying champagne in the clubhouse at distances great than 20 feet. He also crushed two beer cans on his head simultaneously and poured them over unsuspecting TV announcers.</p>
		<p> The Phillies won the World Series in 2008, and Brett Myers definitely contributed to the victory. But he also was kind of a jerk.</p>
