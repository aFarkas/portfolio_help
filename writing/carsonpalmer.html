		<h1>The Resurrection of Carson Palmer</h1>
		<p>Sports and religion&mdash;two of the most controversial, yet satisfying topics to talk about. Forgive me if I expand the argument even further&mdash;I am proclaiming Carson Palmer the new Jesus of the NFL. The man has enjoyed the ultimate career resurrection.</p>
		<p> Let&rsquo;s review the man&rsquo;s early career&mdash;when he attending to his first flock, the USC Trojans. Carson pretty much killed it at USC&mdash;he was responsible for much of Pete&rsquo;s Carroll&rsquo;s success when he began his tenure with the program, beating Iowa in the 2003 Orange Bowl. Carson&rsquo;s roommates in college consisted of Matt Cassel and Troy Polamalu, not a bad pair of disciples to follow you into the NFL. Carson won the Heisman in 2003, and PAC-10's career leader for completions, attempts, and passing yards upon graduating. He was the number one overall pick that year, going to the Cincinnati Bengals. Palmer actually sat out his first year, something rare for a number one pick&mdash;Jon Kitna actually a decent season for the Bengals that year. But Carson was handed the Holy Grail the next season&mdash;the starting job&mdash;and sucked at it. He threw 18 interceptions, had a 77.3 QB rating, and lead the Bengals to a mediocre 8-8 season. But Carson would begin to preach the following season.</p>
		<p> Let&rsquo;s look at Palmer&rsquo;s 2005 season. A 67.8 completion percentage, complete with almost 4,000 yards, 32 touchdowns, and a 101.1 QB rating! And guess what: The Bengals went 11-5 that year, their best showing since 1990! They ended up losing to the Steelers in the first round of the playoffs, suffering a season-ending knee injury after Steelers defensive tackle Kimon von Oelhoffen dove for Palmer. The injury would inspire a new regulation in the offseason, prohibiting defenders from intentionally hitting a passer at or below the knee. This rule would become known as the Carson Palmer rule.</p>
		<p> So Carson Palmer finally made it into the bible&mdash;well, the NFL rulebook at least. He came back from the injury next season, and defied expectations with another incredible year&mdash;making the Pro Bowl and placing third in comeback player of the year award. But then came the dip. In 2008 and 2009, Palmer suffered from nagging injury problems and a team that could not get passed the first round of the playoffs. He requested to be traded in 2010, but the Bengals turned him down. So Carson retired&mdash;and went to the Raiders, where he had two more tough seasons.</p>
		<p>Lets turn to Numberfire&rsquo;s Sal Cacciatore for a more thorough analysis. There&rsquo;s a fancy stat called Adjusted Net Yards Per Pass, which is basically a more stat anal way to measure yards per pass, as it takes into account sacks and interceptions. And it&rsquo;s also adjusted for inflation---yes, there is inflation in football&mdash;reflecting that the NFL has become more pass heavy in recent years. Let&rsquo;s look at the chart&mdash;100 marks the league average, and each 15 points represent one standard deviation above the mean. Palmer had above-average seasons early in his career, but skidded throughout his latter tenure with the Bengals and Raiders. And then the miracle happened.</p>
		<p>Palmer was traded to the Bengals in 2013. He led the Cardinals to 10-6 his first year, and was having a good year in 2014, but then got injured again.</p>
		<p>But in 2015, the messiah has finally come. He&rsquo;s 9-2 through Week 13, with over 3,000 yards so far and nearly 30 TD, which is insane considering there&rsquo;s still a lot of football to be played. There&rsquo;s a crowdfunding campaign to pay the NFL fine he received for his excessive thrusting celebration against the 49ers. And he can still scramble&mdash;in Week 12 on a goal line score, he reached a top speed of 18.88 miles, which was faster than Adrian Peterson&rsquo;s top speed that week. Yes, Adrian fucking Peterson. It&rsquo;s on NFL.com, on not making it up!</p>
		<p>Tom Brady&rsquo;s going to get MVP, but my word, Carson Palmer jersey-wearing locusts will swarm the earth if Palmer doesn&rsquo;t get comeback of the year. Or a Superbowl ring. Or both.</p>
