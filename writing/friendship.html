		<h1>Friendship</h1>
		<p>I don&rsquo;t usually remember how I met my closest friends. It&rsquo;s like they passed through a thin film and came out the other side my friend. I&rsquo;m using the thin film analogy because I just read on my acne medication tube to apply a thin film of cream each evening. So the analogy works perfectly&mdash;I apply a thin film of my friends to my loneliness each evening (well, perhaps once or twice a week), and out comes a sense of higher self-worth, because I feel less like a loner and have less acne. Jeez, I&rsquo;m starting to sound like a teenager with low self-esteem. I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m Zeus on the throne, but I don&rsquo;t want to degrade myself into a high-schooler.</p>
		<p> Anyway, the best friends I have are the ones I have stuck it out with for years. This is because they stop feeling like mutual acquaintances who share certain self-interests, and start feeling like your family. Whatever mutual connection that brought me together in the 1<sup>st</sup> grade at Stackpole Elementary School is long obsolete at this point. If I was still riding that one mutual experience out now, than the friendship would be pretty one dimensional. And entirely based on Pokemon cards.</p>
		<p> No, I decided to let me friendships develop. And that&rsquo;s hard. People drift apart as they grow older, develop different interests, go different places. It&rsquo;s not like I try on purpose to become different than my friends, it&rsquo;s just that I grow in certain ways that they do not. And the reciprocal is true as well.</p>
		<p> This &ldquo;life&rdquo; evolving that happens makes it quite hard to connect with my friends at times. Of course I say this, and then I go somewhere else and realize it&rsquo;s hard to connect with new people. That&rsquo;s why I love hanging on to old friends&mdash;they know you better than anyone, there is a shared implicit &lsquo;rhythm&rsquo; in the friendship, personalities interlock naturally, and the past is something both parties can draw on. Nostalgia, baby. Old friends are great. But it&rsquo;s nice to think about new ones too, even though they don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
		<p> I&rsquo;ve also realized that the friend who shares all your interests while doing nothing to piss you off is entirely a myth. Sometimes I think I look for too much from my friends and concentrate too hard what I view as the dumb parts of their personality. This is stupid, because I know I have annoying, shitty parts of my personality that piss my friends off. I think the best I can do is just concentrate on the attributes of my friends that are rewarding and make me happy, and just try to avoid/power through the parts of the relationship that don&rsquo;t serve any positive purpose. There&rsquo;s no use forcing a blueprint on a friend, because they control how they present themselves in the friendship.</p>
		<p> The inverse is something that confuses me a bit more. I know it&rsquo;s not healthy to control my friends, but sometimes I think, are my friends controlling me? I read somewhere that a person is an approximate amalgamation of their few closest friends. Following this logic, am I being controlled and changed as a person based on the kind of friends I have. It&rsquo;s a scary thought to think about, and one that goes against my hope that I am the chief architect of myself. But I hear all this shit about network effects, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s who you know&rsquo;, etc. How much of this concerns with strong social ties like friends? If all my friends were a certain &ldquo;thing&rsquo;, there&rsquo;s a good chance I&rsquo;d be that &ldquo;thing&rdquo; as well. But I&rsquo;m sure most people who have close friends that aren&rsquo;t what they are, but rather share personality traits or a shared past. People do change independently of their friends and maintain friendships. It&rsquo;s not like humans are attached at the hip by a set of railroad tracks, and each member of the chain is affected when a person changes? I&rsquo;d like to think that people change independently of one another&mdash;yeah, sometimes this has a huge network effect, I&rsquo;d wager most of the time it just introduces more nuances that color a friendship in more subtle ways.</p>
		<p> I think it&rsquo;s the weathering of a friendship as these nuances develop that really test how close two people are. If both individuals change and still maintain the friendship, odds are they are very committed to each other.</p>
		<p> So I guess my takeaways about friendship are that they exist in flux, are not perfect, and are definitely defined by time. This stuff is rewarding but not easy.</p>
