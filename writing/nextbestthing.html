		<h1>Doing The Next Best Thing</h1>
		<p> I think doing the next best thing is an important virtue to live by. Sometimes I don&rsquo;t want to do anything. Like today. I told myself I was going to put my website online. I edited a few lines of HTML and then gave up. I&rsquo;m not sure why I got so easily discouraged&mdash;it probably had a lot to do with the fact that I read a lot of other people&rsquo;s crap online that made be less confident in what I am doing. Like this Silicon Valley bigwig who wrote, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not the best programmer in the world and are not doing something that doesn&rsquo;t make you happy, you probably aren&rsquo;t going to do your best!&rdquo; I&rsquo;m probably misquoting him, but it made me feel sad. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is because I have high expectations of myself (high expectations aren&rsquo;t a terrible thing to have, but they can oftentimes cause stress and other stupid stuff), or because he has high expectations of everyone else. All I know is, I reacted to what he and the other part of the Internet said, and it took away from what I wanted to do.</p>
		<p> So this is where doing the next best thing comes in. It&rsquo;s genius because it doesn&rsquo;t make me feel lame or berated for absolutely sucking at something one day. Everybody must have days where they stink at doing things. That&rsquo;s what the word Sunday was invited for. In fact, going to church was just a fancy socio-religious construct to allow people to have one day a week to do absolutely nothing. This probably isn&rsquo;t true, but it makes me feel better, because there&rsquo;s tons of atheists who need a day off, and just because they don&rsquo;t go to church doesn&rsquo;t mean they can&rsquo;t exercise that right.</p>
		<p> Doing the next best thing also puts the emphasis on the future. Economists love the theory of sunk cost&mdash;even if you snorkeled in the pond full of goldfish waste for 40 years, you can still always swim to shore and start making a profit off of highly-mercurial goldfish compost. In short, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what crap you did in the past to bring you to your future success&mdash;there&rsquo;s always time to discard and try anew, and eventually that process will yield happiness and success.</p>
		<p> I&rsquo;m trying to practice this experiment in real time. Let&rsquo;s analyze what I did today: a symphony of nose-picking, an afternoon of football, and an hour conversation with my best friend from college. Not a bad day in the leisure department. But I also did a lot of procrastinating, especially in the evening when I wanted to actually accomplish stuff. But you know what? I freaking loved today. I didn&rsquo;t attend church this morning, and I still managed to pump out a full day of religiously-authorized donothingness. And when I felt that I had to emerge from the goldfish poop-filled vacuum of my life and write, I listened to the economists and put fist to keyboard. And at 1:26 AM, it yielded something productive and enjoyable.</p>
