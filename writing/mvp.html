		<h1>Who Should Be the 2015 NFL MVP?</h1>
		<p>Ah yes, Cameron Newton. It&rsquo;s true that he has the team on his back and I will give you the argument the he really has no one around him except for Greg Olsen, who has scored three touchdowns in the last 4 games, with at least 65 yards each game. Not to get all Fanduel up in here, but that&rsquo;s like 12 fantasy points a week, which is very solid, at least for my teams. But yes, Fanduel is gambling and should be banned.</p>
		<p>Tis literally no one else on the Panthers. The runningback is 28 years old and 3.88 yards a carry, Kelvin Benjamin is out, Ted Ginn Jr. caught 21 out of 50 passes, Jericho Cotchery is older than my grandma&rsquo;s doormat, and the rookie Devin Funchess has only has 161 career yards, although he had a very impressive game in the win against the packers. In fact, the receivers actually showed up this week to beat Green Bay, combining for nine catches, 223 yards and two touchdowns. So maybe things are looking up&hellip;but probably not.</p>
		<p> Where Cam Newton gets burned a lot is in his passing ability. He has a 53.7 passing percentage and is ranked 24/32 according to ESPN QBR. But people always say that Cam Newtown has to be judged differently because he is a college quarterback&mdash;&ldquo;aka a mediocre passer and proficient runner.&rdquo; What Tebow could only dream of being. The man rushed 10 times for 57 yards against a Packers run defense which is admittedly not that great, but he pulled off an unbelievable break-the-plane goalline touchdown, something akin to more of what a fullback should be used for.</p>
		<p>But take a look at this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2015/11/10/lets-pump-the-brakes-on-cam-newtons-mvp-talk/" target="_blank">stat package</a> from Neil Greenberg at WaPo. Newton&nbsp;goes from&nbsp;a passer rating of 97.1 to 41.8 when facing a pass rush. And that&rsquo;s despite the Panthers&rsquo; offensive line allowing fewer sacks, hits and hurries than New England this season. Take a look at this chart. The Panther&rsquo;s o-line is ok. The New England o-line doesn&rsquo;t even exist. Newtown&rsquo;s running does make things easier for the offensive line. In points, Newton&rsquo;s ability to run with the football has been worth 6.5 more expected points over Brady during the course of the season, or roughly one point per game.</p>
		<p> Yes, Brady is having one of the best year of his career at 38-years-old. The media is obsessed with the Deflategate storyline, as if Tom Brady had to redeem himself or something. The suspension was appealed for chrissake, get over it! But <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonrubin91" target="_blank">Jason Rubin</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/tytsports/featured" target="_blank">TYTSports</a> brought up an amazing statistic&mdash;an average of 1.72 seconds to get rid of the ball. While Cam Newton is certainly carrying his team, Brady is not operating in a vacuum either. His offensive line is TERRIBLE. Worst in the league. And he had to adapt his game to get the ball quickly, which is very hard. As an eagles fan, when the offensive line doesn&rsquo;t show up, Sam Bradford doesn&rsquo;t even have a shot. Brady is doing something very special in New England this season, and he certainly is the best quarterback in the National Football League. And as Jason said, with the award having such arbitrary guidelines and using going to a quarterback, I&rsquo;d be surprised if Tom Brady doesn&rsquo;t get it.</p>
		<p> That said, Carson Palmer definitely should be in the mix. He&rsquo;s leading the lead in QBR, has a 110 passer rating, and certainly having a hell of comeback season. I&rsquo;d argue the Cardinals would be just as bad without him as the Panthers would without Newtown. Oh wait, that did happen last year. They were 6-0 with Palmer and 5-5 without him, and lost terribly in the first round of the playoffs. So if you get voter fatigue and don&rsquo;t want to be a &lsquo;Patriotic&rsquo; this year, vote Palmer!</p>
