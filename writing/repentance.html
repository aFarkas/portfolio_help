		<h1>Repentance</h1>
		<p>I imagine that repentance is a major part of most modern religions. The half- decent ones, anyway. And I pretty much believe that any religion is half-decent, at best&mdash;there are very spiritually and ethically powerful lessons embedded in all of them, but also a lot of close-minded, intolerant, and outmoded ways of thinking. The key, at least on some buffet-style level, is to sift through the shit and pull out the chicken wings. But anyway&mdash;I do believe that any &lsquo;half-decent&rsquo; religion ought to promote some form of repentance.</p>
		<p> It&rsquo;s not as if I believe in sin, or that our bad deeds will sentence us to hell or even come back to bite us. I think one of the crises (among many) that religion has been having over the past 100 years is that the prior forms of &lsquo;warning&rsquo; that it heeded as punishment for bad deeds&mdash;whether it be hell, disease, curses, or stake-burning&mdash;has pretty much been outlawed or proved wrong by science. So now it appears that there really are no terrible reasons not to be a dick. You can lie, cheat, and steal all you want, and as long as you are in the confines of the law (or don&rsquo;t get caught), you can pretty much get away with anything. And you&rsquo;re not gonna get the plague because of it, because we now know that the plague is caused by vector-bearing fleas that travel on rats, not God&rsquo;s mighty sword. And modern hygiene, got rid of the plague anyway, so the worse that can happen is you cheat on someone&rsquo;s wife and get the flu. Well, you could get cancer or something more unpleasant. But most likely, what happens to you is not a result of God being mad. It&rsquo;s just a result of life happening. (Not trying to unleash an unwinnable argument about God right now. Too many wars have been fought and lost trying to do that. Better to agree to disagree.)</p>
		<p> Anyway, I wanted to slog through this long-winded point because I believe that repentance is now more important than ever. Because we don&rsquo;t have to worry about repenting to ward off evil spirits or protect ourselves against diseases that only attack jerks, we can now concentrate on my favorite reason to repent&mdash;because we feel sorry. Yep, turns out humans have being doing bad stuff while feeling sorry about it later for centuries. Religion gave a structure to repentance, but sometimes the basic reasons for expressing regret got mired in the process. Genuinely identifying our mistakes, expressing regret at undertaking these actions, and expressing the will to do better are some of the things that I like to do when &ldquo;repenting&rdquo;. But how does one actually do this?</p>
		<p> Is it an actual &ldquo;thing&rdquo; people do, akin to eating a Whopper or flossing teeth, or more of a frame of mind. And when people forget to repent, akin to forgetting to floss or forgetting to <em>not</em> eat a Whopper, do they feel unhappy?</p>
		<p> I&rsquo;m of the camp that repenting should actually be a thing people do. Having repentance &ldquo;frame of mind&rdquo; is just too metaphysical and probably isn&rsquo;t possible to maintain unless you are the Dalai Lama. For us average Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s, maybe taking a few moments out of the routine to consciously examine our mistakes and think how we can fix them is a better choice. We take time out of our day to work on ourselves in other ways&mdash;think the gym or making a kale smoothie&mdash;so why not do the same thing with repentance?</p>
		<p> The Jewish religion actually has a fairly half-decent model for this. Again, I use the word half-decent because it may not work for you as I describe it, but it is transferrable enough that you can easily make it your own thing, with a little wave of your magic wand.</p>
		<p> Anyway, the repentance ritual is called <em>Tikun Olam</em>, or casting away one&rsquo;s sins. If this sounds like a fishing trip, you&rsquo;re in luck, because we are going to a lake.</p>
		<p> First, we must set up camp near a body of water. The only other requirement is to bring a food item that can be split up into little pieces&mdash;a loaf of bread is usually the best choice, because it can be chucked easily and also benefits the wildlife.</p>
		<p> Next, we break up the bread into little pieces, and start thinking about specific instances in the past year where we felt regretful about one of our actions. If you cannot think of a specific instance, try thinking about relationships with others that are important to you, and any bumps in the road that you experienced in the past year.</p>
		<p> For each moment you think of, take a moment to reflect what you could have done better, or more importantly, how you can improve yourself so your actions have better outcomes in the future.</p>
		<p> Lastly, clutch your &ldquo;repentance&rdquo; (aka piece of bread) and lob it in the lake, reservoir, ocean, pool, mall fountain, or other aquatic landmark that you are standing near. Repeat until finished.</p>
		<p> All joking aside, casting away one&rsquo;s sins is a great way to reflect on what you did in the past year, and how you can improve yourself for the next one. I think this action is great because it provides an actionable, quantifiable way to improve yourself. I don&rsquo;t recommend going beyond the past year when dwelling on your actions&mdash;time distorts our memory of our past deeds, and a year is just enough time to be able to reflect accurately on our past while marking a new chapter to our future.</p>
		<p> I hope you enjoy this exercise. Regardless if you think religion is bullshit, repentance is a good thing. And we can all definitely afford to become better humans.</p>
