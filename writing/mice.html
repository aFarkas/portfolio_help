		<h1>Is Killing Mice Humane?</h1>
		<p> Sometimes I wonder why people do not have more lengthy debates about killing animals. Some people kill them everyday&mdash;even big ones, like deer and cows. It&rsquo;s so much a part of habit that it becomes embedded in personality&mdash;as if one cannot separate the killing from the killer. But I don&rsquo;t think this is a bad thing&mdash;people like to hunt, people have to eat, and the vocations of hunter, farmer, and rancher predate almost anything corporate America has came up with in the past 100 years.</p>
		<p> The ironic thing is, people who let animals live have this same habit-forming behavior. The make it their duty to honor all living beings, engage in spiritual and religions ceremonies celebrating animals, and even punish themselves when they step on a bug. It becomes so much a part of their personality that they identify as vegan or Buddhist, just like hunters identify as hunters or Republican. Labels aside, I believe that many people make a conscious decision both to kill and not to kill.</p>
		<p> But there are also many more people that do not. They do not like to see animals be harmed, but they have no problem sticking a nice, fat t-bone steak on their paper plate and dripping some A1 sauce all over that slab of once-breathing flesh. I am one of those people. But there&rsquo;s something that always challenges my conscience when it comes to ending animal life, and it&rsquo;s not the usual issues. It&rsquo;s the question of whether I should kill the mice in my basement.</p>
		<p> Upon first-glance, this is pretty much a no-brainer for me. They make a lot of noise at night, scare the shit out of me, carry disease, poop all over the carpet, invade my food, display their tails, and take the &ldquo;2<sup>nd</sup> highest level of biological complexity medal in my house&rdquo; away from my goldfish. Of course I want them to die. But on a deeper, more ecological level, there&rsquo;s something immensely troubling about killing living things in my house, even they are occupying my turf against my will. For one, they are really complex forms of life with families that have found shelter from harm, which is basically what humans strive to do. They aren&rsquo;t directly hurting me in any way, and do not make too many appearances. They live in a part of my house that I never visit, which is the inside of my basement walls. They do not pose any immediate dangers like bears or plague-ridden fleas (although they probably host a lot of baddies! Potentially.) They are only field mice, which to me is the pussy form of real pests, like rats or cockroaches.</p>
		<p> And also, there&rsquo;s the question of how I bring upon their death. Usually it involves poison, more specifically the kind that acts very slowly, clotting their blood vessels and bringing death to the whole herd at once. According to what I read, this type of death is slow and painless, and very effective&mdash;many things can go wrong with mousetraps, and the more human &ldquo;catch and release&rdquo; method doesn&rsquo;t exactly bode well for eliminating the problem. But still, there&rsquo;s obviously something really chilling about poisoning a mass amount of living beings at once in a slow, ominous fashion. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s appropriate to draw comparison to the mass murder of human life, but still, it&rsquo;s pretty chilling.</p>
		<p> These are the types of things that briefly flash into my mind before I think about murdering the biological life in my ceiling. That&rsquo;s probably a fairly overstated way to describe killing mice, but they are living things too. Even if they disrupt my midnight guitar-playing and make me scream like a little girl.</p>
