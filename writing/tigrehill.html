		<h1><strong><em>Move over Malcolm X! One of the most fascinating and controversial civil rights leaders of all time operated in the streets of North Philadelphia. And while not yet achieving the textbook fame of other prominent civil rights activists, a new drama from Philly filmmaker Tigre Hill is going to change this.</em></strong></h1>
		<p>Philadelphia filmmaker Tigre Hill is bringing civil rights activist Cecil B. Moore to the world. Hill is currently developing a new feature-length biopic chronicling Moore&rsquo;s life as one of Philly&rsquo;s most important civil rights leaders. A controversial figure within the Philadelphia civil rights movement, Moore is remembered for his &ldquo;creative&rdquo; ways of addressing race challenges in the 1960&rsquo;s and 1970&rsquo;s. He was a prominent lawyer who defended many poor, disenfranchised African-Americans in North Philadelphia, and perhaps is best remembered for leading the effort to integrate Girard College.</p>
		<p>But as Tigre Hill will be the first to attest, there is much more to Cecil B. Moore than meets the eye. Despite being an effective civil rights leader, Moore was a very difficult individual, never afraid to challenge or even alienate his allies. &ldquo;Every time I talk to someone who knew Cecil, there&rsquo;s always some unique, funny story about him,&rdquo; Hill reveals. &ldquo;He was a very quirky guy who happened to be a civil rights attorney and a former Marine. He wasn&rsquo;t the typical civil rights activist&mdash;he shook up a lot of things in the city in a very unorthodox way.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Indeed, Moore&rsquo;s story did not even start in Philadelphia. Originally from West Virginia, Moore had aspirations of a military career. He fought in World War II as part of the Montford Point Marines, the first African-American regiment in the history of the United States Marine Corps. Segregation denied Moore and his compatriots the opportunity to train at Parris Island. Instead, they were trained in Camp Montford Point, in Jacksonville, North Carolina.</p>
		<p>After camp, Moore left the U.S. to fight in the South Pacific. Hill states that Moore fought in the Pacific Theatre at the height of the harrowing violence associated with the conflict, yet emerged as a hard-lining, aggressive patriot. &ldquo;Many civil rights leaders would talk about the Constitution and equality,&rdquo; Hill notes. &ldquo;But what Cecil did went above and beyond that. He was a flag-waving patriot, and talked about America as a place to achieve, gain freedom and excel. But he was seeing that wasn&rsquo;t the case.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>After discharge, Moore found his way to Philadelphia, but not with the grand plan of seeking office. Rather, he started as a liquor salesman, eventually graduating from Temple Law School. It was not until he began defending the disenfranchised poor that Moore saw something had to be done to shake up race relations within the city. In the 1960&rsquo;s, Cecil B. Moore launched his storied career, becoming President of the local NAACP in 1963. In 1965, he led the famous picket of Girard College, a male, all-white private boarding school. The school was eventually integrated in 1968.</p>
		<p>Tigre Hill, who has been making films in Philadelphia for many years, is perhaps best known for the documentary &ldquo;The Shame of City&rdquo;, which chronicled the corruption and FBI wiretapping controversy of the 2003 Philly mayoral race. When asked about the differences between making a documentary and narrative film, Tigre instead refers to the similarities. &ldquo;With a documentary and a drama, you have to tell a story. It&rsquo;s a narrative. A famous quote by Hitchcock &ndash; when you&rsquo;re doing a documentary, God is the director. When you&rsquo;re doing a narrative, the director is God. I&rsquo;m trying to merge both of those.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>With principal photography starting at the end of 2015, Hill has his work cut out for him. Luckily, he has assembled a very talented cast. The role of Cecil B. Moore has been awarded to Chris Mann, an esteemed local actor bearing a striking resemblance to his civil rights counterpart.</p>
		<p>But Tigre Hill remains guarded on the more intricate details of the production. When asked about a particular &ldquo;message&rdquo; he might be trying to convey, he is careful not to sound pedantic. &ldquo;This is a story about a unique character&mdash;a universal character study with mass appeal. It&rsquo;s a unique story about a unique life.&rdquo;</p>
