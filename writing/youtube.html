		<h1>How I Started on YouTube</h1>
		<p>I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by YouTube ever since I watched an online experiment called The Show With ZeFrank. The Show was basically a conversation between a 30-year-old guy living in Brooklyn and the rest of the Internet. He mainly talked about the news, but he also interacted with people and nurtured an entire community of people who would do weird things like dress up their vacuum cleaners and make earth sandwiches. I started watching The Show on my iPod Video 5.5g right after it ended. Even though episodes weren&rsquo;t being produced live anymore, it was like I found a big brother (the mentor kind, not the George Orwell kind) who could find a way to make the news geeky and fun, but in a way that was more personable than watching The Daily Show or a television news cast. I felt as if he was speaking to me in the same room, and I shared a common experience with them. This is what I think is best about the Internet&mdash;when you learn something and make a friend doing it.</p>
		<p> Since then, social media happened, which was really cool because it connected me with other interesting people, but also very lame because it re-introduced me to boring people from high school. I don&rsquo;t use it much for the latter anymore (Facebook). Fuck, this is supposed to be about online video.</p>
		<p> So naturally, like a few other people, I tried to imitate Zefrank. I made several videos about politics and Bernie Sanders, which in hindsight were fun, even if they weren&rsquo;t very well. I think the Bernie Sanders one got about 500 views, which wasn&rsquo;t a bad number, even though I thought it was at the time. The funny thing about the Internet in 2012 was that YouTube was an established entity, much more than it was in 2007 when the show ended, but there really wasn&rsquo;t much infrastructure in place for promoting YouTube videos. Or at least not as much as today!</p>
		<p> Now, everywhere you look, there are companies promoting brand management strategies, audience development tactics, and a bunch of other bullshit. Even though it sounds corporatized and hollow, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s actually very cool stuff, and I&rsquo;ve exposed myself to it a bit already, through doing the YouTube Creator Academy and reading about how online video is consumed.</p>
		<p> So a few weeks ago, I decided to give this video thing a real shot, and I created a channel called Hawt4Hillary, which is supposed to highlight Hillary Clinton news from an actual thinking millennial. I made a video about Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s father that I was proud of, but since then I&rsquo;ve kind of been distracted making sports videos for another cool YouTube outlet, The Young Turks.</p>
		<p> When it comes to making videos, or taking part in any artistic expression for public consumption, I think there are always dilemmas one has to face. &ldquo;Should I make what I think I would want to watch, or make what I think about be popular&rdquo;? I always hear everyone advocating for the first route, because the second oftentimes leads to hollow, generic crap and the former creates genuine, heartfelt expression. But I also read that YouTube videos now-a-days should be centered around a &ldquo;theme&rdquo; and not the directionless, vlog-dribble that doesn&rsquo;t really have a point (or does it? Maybe this disguised direction is what makes these videos so popular?) that might have succeeded beforehand. But there&rsquo;s a certain personality and authenticity that shines through in a personal blog that might not be captured in a themed video, but it can also run the risk of being too vague and directionless.</p>
		<p> I think people use YouTube for different things. Some use it to watch commercial content they missed on TV, which is the lamest use of the platform I can think of. Others use it to make new friends, which is how vloggers become popular. And others use it for education, discovery, and broadening the mind. So maybe I don&rsquo;t have to totally abandon myself while making a video that is about an actual topic. In fact, I&rsquo;m realizing now they aren&rsquo;t mutually exclusive&mdash;maybe there is a sweet spot of including just enough of oneself of a video to make an impression, while also presenting a topic that actually means something.</p>
		<p>I&rsquo;m just debating now whether I should keep making these sports videos, concentrate on Hillary full-time, or start recording my embarrassing diary entries. Honestly, they all seem like fun options, but sticking with one might be smarter. It&rsquo;s a good problem to have, I guess!</p>
