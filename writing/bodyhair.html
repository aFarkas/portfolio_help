		<h1>Body Hair</h1>
		<p>The thing I want to get off my chest is that my body is too hairy. Pun. When I was younger, I thought only older men had body hair, because that&rsquo;s all I was exposed to. I only ever saw two people with their shirts off&mdash;my father and grandfather. Yes, I was exposed to movies and television depictions of men with their shirts off, but that kind of experience did not have the same effect as being around living, breathing humans with large, jungle-esque swaths of body hair.</p>
		<p>Being at least tangentially related to these hairy older men made me predisposed to getting lots of body hair myself. I tried to delay this outcome for as long as possible. As a child, I embraced my pre-pubescent youth&mdash;body hair only occupied the darkest depths of my nightmares and were whisked away as soon as I looked into a mirror. And when I started to enter the frightening, hairy beginnings of adolescence, I was able to coast by with a deep voice that seemed to fit Robert Goulet better than a skinny, short Jewish 15-year-old.</p>
		<p>And then it happened. The dreaded beginnings of chest hair. I had already looked in horror as the older counselors at my camp were sporting a Fu Manchu across their breastbone as they dutifully hopped off the diving board every afternoon. The chest mustaches soaked up the water with glee, and looked even darker and more weighty in the chlorine-tinged cesspool that was the camp swimming area. It was like the chest hair was saying, &ldquo;Look at me! I&rsquo;m full of chlorine and baby ruths from 5-year-old assholes and I&rsquo;m not afraid to show it!&rdquo; By the summer&rsquo;s end, there was enough shit and chemically dubious elements in that chest hair to comprise a new section of the Periodic Table. And a barber who moonlighted as a toxic materials inspector would have to come and collect the hair in a red pharmaceutical containers. It was bad.</p>
		<p>Anyway, I was one of those camp counselors that year. My chest hair had budded during the winter and was finally out in the open. It signaled even more that I was a 70&rsquo;s heartthrob ladies man ripe for the plucking. The only problem was that it was 2008, and I had the confidence of a beaver at a lumberjack convention. So, I didn&rsquo;t really end up meeting any women until college, when it became socially acceptable (or at least <em>tolerated</em>) to be hairy in public.</p>
