		<h1>Meeting My Past Self</h1>
		<p> A funny thing happened to me today. I switched on my computer, and I was rummaging through the poopsmear of files on my computer, and I opened a document containing an essay I wrote to a graduate student. The contents of the essay were basically a plea to get this poor reader to change my grade. But the way I did it was very weird and a wee bit on the bold side&mdash;I invoked Hurricane Sandy.</p>
		<p> That&rsquo;s right&mdash;talked about one of the most dangerous and serious natural events ever to occur in United States history alongside an explanation into why my B+ should be changed to an A+. The gall! The heresy! One would think I was a member of the Spartan army, hastily disguised as an Athenian in the heat of the battle, before I stripped off my vile, poop-encrusted mask and thrust my blade into an unsuspecting graduate&rsquo;s student&rsquo;s heart. The heart, mind you, was already weak from the emotional imagery I evoked of sinking homes and abandoned families. It was if I was sliding a serrated blade into a soft slab of butter, milking the graduate student&rsquo;s empathy for all it&rsquo;s grade-inflationary worth. And by god I succeeded in my quest&hellip;while defaming millions of hurricane-affected tri-state area families in the process. That&rsquo;s the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut tri-state area for all you humans unfamiliar with the naming conventions of New Yorkers. Which is probably most of you. Although <i>they</i> certainly don&rsquo;t realize that.</p>
		<p> I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that I would never have remembered writing that essay if it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact I was dicking around my computer. That part of me would literally be dead and never even visited once in the cemetery. But it was almost like stumbling upon a gravestone and meeting an old friend&mdash;I was introduced to the very immature thought-patterns of my 2012 self, while marveling at the fact that I was able to craft a quasi-legitimate argument that my grade should be changed.</p>
		<p> I also want to get out of the way that I am not that much of a jerk for bringing up Hurricane Sandy in my essay. Part of the &lsquo;protocol&rsquo; for changing grades is that the graduate student wanted us to write about something else besides the reason for the change in the paper, so she wouldn&rsquo;t be bored to death while slogging through our argument. Apparently graduate students have a read a lot of snoozer papers, although this is probably just a long-standing rumor whose validity will never be proven. Anyway, I heeded the grad student&rsquo;s advice and incorporated a very gripping commentary into Hurricane Sandy in my paper, which made the thing a very enjoyable read these years later.</p>
		<p> And to answer your question, yes&mdash;the grade was changed. I think. I hope. I&rsquo;d like to think my previous self knew what he was doing. But that&rsquo;s probably not the case. Because my present self certainly doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
