		<h1>How the Hillary Clinton Benghazi testimony is like The Godfather: Part Two</h1>
		<p> Last week we all heard a lot of shite about Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s testimony at the Benghazi hearings. It reminded me a lot of that scene in the Godfather Two, when the Corleone family is interrogated by the House Committee Into Organized Crime Activities, or whatever the hell they decided to call it. Michael and the rest of the gang are forced to testify, but they flatly deny any association with the countless murders suspected of them. White-haired, balding Congressman flex their muscles and are incredibly stern in their interrogation practices, but the mob&rsquo;s lawyer (Robert Duvall!) has a better understanding of the law than the congressmen! There are a lot of specific dates about by the prosecution, many of which are known to the audience to be accurate, but the Corleones certainly do not want to admit to crimes, especially if there is no evidence against them. In the end, the mob brings in a star witness, a member of the family who was tricked by the government into believing he was double-crossed by the Corleones. But the Corleones bring in <em>their </em>star witness, an old soul from Italy who makes the government&rsquo;s witness realize the family was not responsible for the trick. In the end, the star witness refuses to testify, the hearing goes nowhere, and the press goes home upset and confused.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p> This long-winded depiction of a fictional hearing from a classic 70&rsquo;s movie was not invoked in vain! As you probably realized already, the Hillary Clinton hearing played out exactly in this fashion, except there was no overarching plotline that was moved forward because of it. Well, let me redact that statement&mdash;if Hillary wins, this event will surely be viewed as a half-hearted, factless attempt by a Republican congress to crucify a strong Democratic candidate for President. If she loses, the hearing will be viewed as the first major inquiry into Hillary&rsquo;s unforgivable foreign policy blunder. In a way, it&rsquo;s similar to the Republican-controlled hearing to oust Bill Clinton&mdash;entirely partisan, motivated to weaken a strong opposition candidate, and conducted by people who have already made up their minds even before testimony began. Admittedly, this is more of a serious issue, as an ambassador died and there aren&rsquo;t any stained dresses to be thrown around. And I don&rsquo;t think anyone wants to waste time arguing what the &ldquo;definition of is, is&rdquo;. This crap is long enough as it is.</p>
		<p> Here are 5 ways the Benghazi Hearing is basically the real life version of the Corleone mob trial:</p>
		<p> </p>
		<ol>
		<li><strong>There are two sides, and both have already made up their minds</strong>. The Republicans want to tarnish Hillary&rsquo;s image, the mob committee wants to lock up the Corleones. Both Hillary and the mob want to escape unscathed, and with a few belly laughs.</li>
		<li><strong>The prosecution is incredibly angry, but they have little criminal evidence to back up their accusations.</strong> The truth is, even with all the testimony, no one really knows exactly what happened in moment when the Ambassador was killed. Speculation is rampant. How much was Hillary connected with the event itself, and did she try to cover anything up? I&rsquo;m sure she did, but the answer probably lies somewhere between the Democrat and Republican analysis. Too bad we&rsquo;ll never know.</li>
		<li><strong>The defense is too powerful to be brought down.</strong> Hillary Clinton and Michael Corleone are the two most powerful people in their respective &ldquo;games&rdquo;. The House doesn&rsquo;t have any ability to hurt these people, and in some instances they are lining the pockets of the same people they are purporting to prosecute.</li>
		<li><strong>The viewing public barely knows what is going on.</strong> In both trials, you have to be an insider to have any semblance of understanding of the specifics. It&rsquo;s almost as if they make it harder on purpose for the public to understand. I realize it is the news&rsquo;s job to make sense of what is happening, but even they project their own biases into the event. After the event is distilled through so many layers, how accurate can the testimony&rsquo;s portrayal be by the time it reaches the viewer?</li>
		<li><strong>Both Hillary and Michael Corleone enjoy denying everything.</strong></li>
		</ol>
		<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence, so why would they be required to admit anything? If anything, it&rsquo;s good publicity, because this pointless trial is making the opposition look like the bullies, even when they might have some fair points.</p>
