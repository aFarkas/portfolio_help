		<h1>A Letter from Future Me</h1>
		<p>Dan, I am you. But I am not you. You have changed. The things you have experienced, the places you been, the people you have met, they have affected you. You&rsquo;re only human, Dan. You don&rsquo;t exist in a vacuum.</p>
		<p>I, however, am different. I am not human, therefore I don&rsquo;t exist in a vacuum. I hate to get all computer science, recursive, &ldquo;if-then&rdquo; statement-esque with this (sorry Dan, if you don&rsquo;t remember at this point in your life you were taking a web development course), but I&rsquo;m just bits, maybe bytes, I&rsquo;m not sure which is bigger in terms of data storage. (Jesus, I feel the analytical objectivity of computers just bleeding into the ethos of this piece, oh god, I might need to conjure up a greeting card picture of an overweight Mrs. Dursley-from-the-Harry-Potter-series-in-a-yellow-dress-with-a-mole-on-her-face-bursting-out-of-a-heavily-iced-vanilla-custard-cake to break the drone of this thing. GAH!) Anyway, what I&rsquo;m trying to say, Dan, is that I am just words on a page. I don&rsquo;t change. I&rsquo;m static, I&rsquo;m computers. I&rsquo;m print. You can go back in time when you interact with me. Cool no?</p>
		<p>Cool, but freakin&rsquo; scary, but also so cool that it becomes commonplace and no one stops to think twice about it. People can go back in time any time they want&mdash;just crack open the ol&rsquo; Readers Digest, or better yet, the Poor Richard&rsquo;s Almanac (because <em>that</em> shit will be what the people in 5000 years will remember. Benjamin Frankin is immortal.) This is such a powerful thing that it stops being exciting to people. It becomes regular, commonplace, trite, routine&mdash;that it somehow loses the sheen of its power. And I do concede that reading a page can never represent the totality of an experience. But if something that could successfully present reality (ahem time machine), were invented, and was presented to the general public akin to library books on a shelf, would even that cease to be magical? Probably.</p>
		<p>Anyway, Dan, it&rsquo;s good to stop thinking about things in such global terms. Which is quite hard for a philosopher and &ldquo;curioust&rdquo; (pressing ignore to get rid of the red squiggly on that word!) do this so readily? Maybe the solution is to globalize the good and localize the bad? That seems like a good idea, no?</p>
		<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I do know that I, the text presently and forever existing on this page, is very confused about life at the moment. I guess it&rsquo;s because I love being immortal&mdash;I will always exist in this space as I am, while you have to go out into the world and grow. I enjoy staying the same, not having to be affected by reality, but secretly I&rsquo;m always afraid of becoming you.</p>
		<p>Why? Well, you have to faces challenges daily, many of them unknowns. You have to constantly face the future while living in the present. In short, you have to &ldquo;become&rdquo; something. You also have to &ldquo;are&rdquo; something, although that one is a little bit harder to conceptualize for me.</p>
		<p>But here&rsquo;s the real fear of mine. You see, our relationship is even more interconnected than Harry Potter and Voldemort, to stay with this ridiculous young adult readings theme of ours that I actually enjoyed establishing. Anyway, my fear is that I am constantly becoming you. That makes no sense. Ok, look at it this way: we both live on a scale, a fluid device made of water or Kool-Aid or some other viscous children&rsquo;s drink. I&rsquo;m on one side of the scale, the left side, because I&rsquo;m humanity&rsquo;s representation of the static and the past. I&rsquo;m the gooey cherry-red half-frozen Kool-Aid Jammers drink that your 3<sup>rd</sup> grade self was so fascinated by. And you, you are living right on the edge of the event horizon, in the ever present, on the right end of the scale.</p>
		<p>Now, imagine the scale being tipped diagonally, so that you are at the bottom right of this universe we created, and I am at the top left. Next, throw in gravity, but have gravity represent time.</p>
		<p> Ok, so this &ldquo;time-gravity&rdquo; (this is all crazy by the way, but I&rsquo;m loving writing this) is constantly pushing me downward against you. I&rsquo;m on a diagonal, so it&rsquo;s not quite a free-fall, but I can constantly see myself become you, making choices, having to approach this present. In short, I&rsquo;m always tied to where you will be. I&rsquo;ll always have to make choices and approach the future. But that&rsquo;s scary, so I&rsquo;m trying to hold out. I&rsquo;m trying to run up this scale like a Roborovski hamster scurrying up a greasy spatula to nab a shiny hunk of Gouda. Except the spatula is suspending on top of Kingda Ka, while Kinda Ka is suspending on the tippy-top of its 300 foot drop. Pretty futile, but still fun to try, especially if you are a Roborovski hamster who was conditioned by Stalin to always have the 5 Year Plan in mind.</p>
		<p> So yeah, case in point it&rsquo;s scary for me to see that we are interconnected, and that you will always be me. <em>Will always be me</em>. But it&rsquo;s something I got to accept, dawg. It might be fun for you to read me in a few milliseconds/minutes/years and see how my thought processes operated from your lofty ledge of hindsight, but I&rsquo;m living in the now man. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen. And with you always around the corner, I don&rsquo;t want to mess you up. Because I love you, Dan. You&rsquo;re someone I try to perfect, to not screw up, to get on some kind of &ldquo;path&rdquo; (or maybe more aptly, to not ruin other potential paths). In short, I think about you too much. Because even though you&rsquo;re real, you are not real right this moment. So maybe I should start thinking about me. Bye bye.</p>
