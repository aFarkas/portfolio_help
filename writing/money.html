		<h1>Doing Stuff For The Money</h1>
		<p> Money is probably one of the most universal things on this planet. It corrupts people, motivates people, enriches people, and enslaves people. In fact, any emotion related to humans can be funneled through money.</p>
		<p> Sometimes I don&rsquo;t even know what money is. It&rsquo;s easy to define it in material terms&mdash;dollars and cents. But what is it exactly that makes people want money? I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s the most objective indicator of value that humans have ever invented. There&rsquo;s other things that many people love&mdash;big butts, pizza, and cuddly cats&mdash;but even these &ldquo;universal&rdquo; objects have their detractors. Some people are health freaks. Some men only like boobs. And others would rather have a dog chase them around than have to deal with a ruthlessly independent, self-cleaning, only pooping in one spot, hairball-spitting mammal who won&rsquo;t follow you around.</p>
		<p> But with money, there is no disagreement. A house doesn&rsquo;t cost 300,000 cats&mdash;it costs $300,000. This is crappy logic, but the point I am making is that money is the most easily quantifiable, agreed-upon way to exchange value that humans have ever created. Bartering was a real crapshoot&mdash;no one knew if they were talking to a cat lover or a butt man, and it would be hard, perhaps even impossible, to carry these things around. Gold was a little bit better&mdash;it was universally agreed upon to be worth something. But gold is very fragile and hard to acquire&mdash;empires had to be created and enslave tons of people just to get it! But money is a different story. The only value it has is that other people agree it has value. A simplistic analysis would say this is the worst idea ever&mdash;what if someone doesn&rsquo;t agree that money is worth something? The answer is that that person is out of luck&mdash;money has network effects, which means it wouldn&rsquo;t work if a lot of people weren&rsquo;t using it. Evil stuff has network effects&mdash;Facebook, religion, Yugioh Cards, and Justin Bieber come to mind. Just kidding, I had a lot of fun playing Yugioh.</p>
		<p> So if everybody agrees money has value, it is used by everyone, and it is never going out of style, why is there controversy about doing stuff for the money? Why do Christianity and thousands of other religions warn against greed? Marx would say it&rsquo;s just to keep the rich in power. But what about utility?</p>
		<p> Utility is a fancy word made up by the philosopher John Stuart Mill to describe doing something for the sake of doing it. This is a phenomenon called fun. When you start doing stuff for the money that you previously did for fun, some people feel that it becomes less fun. Why is this? I have no freaking idea. It&rsquo;s just something that happens in people&rsquo;s brains?</p>
		<p> Other people do stuff for fun and happen to get paid for it, and don&rsquo;t care about the money. Some people start out doing stuff for the fun and then get paid. But do people ever start out doing stuff for the money and then start having fun? I don&rsquo;t hear about that scenario as much&hellip;</p>
		<p> I&rsquo;ve found that making money isn&rsquo;t a bad thing. It helps you have fun. That said, I do not like doing things just to make money that I do not enjoy at all. And I certainly do not like doing things that I do not like at all. That is why doing things &ldquo;just for the money&rdquo; is a tough sell&hellip;but this is life, and things are never so simple.</p>
		<p> One refrain I hear many times is to do what you like. If this lines up with capitalism&rsquo;s profit motive, you are probably luckier than most. If it doesn&rsquo;t, this is where I get confused. Should I start trying to make money off the stuff I like? Should I do stuff I &ldquo;kinda like&rdquo; for the money? Or should I leave some things just for personal enjoyment, because money would desecrate it and end up making me less happy?</p>
		<p> The answer is probably somewhere between all those things. But I&rsquo;m going to continue to do stuff that makes me happy. I think that makes the most sense.</p>
