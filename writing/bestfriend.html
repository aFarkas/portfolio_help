		<h1>What is a Best Friend?</h1>
		<p>For me, a best friend is someone I know so well that they turn into an all-consuming, amorphous blob of an idea. They cease being a person I can easily categorize with a sprinkle of a few adjectives.</p>
		<p>My best friend is a part of me, an extra testicle that would cause oceans of pain if suddenly detached from my life.</p>
		<p>Think of the person you know the most in your life that isn&rsquo;t related to you. They are utterly complex. You remember the terrible times in their life, and times where they shined brighter than an orthodontist&rsquo;s smile. You&rsquo;ve probably spent years watching them grow and develop. And they probably shared the great and shit times in your life as well.</p>
		<p>The fact that a best friend can be so utterly wrapped up in another individual can sometimes make things hard. For one, it totally destroys any semblance of objectivity. Sure, you can be honest and respectful&mdash;most best friends treat each other as they would want to be treated. But there is a certain kinship present in this relationship that obliterates any hope of making objective, unbiased decisions.</p>
		<p>Mostly, this is something that is not serious. Say you want to get a sandwich with your best pal. You want that fat turkey and pastrami, with some spicy Gulden&rsquo;s ketchup and some nice, chunky Kosher pickles. However, your friend is always a dead ringer for cheesesteaks. He will not ever even consider the possibility of containing another sandwich within his belly besides the Philly favorite. And because you know each other so well, you both know about this dilemma before it even manifests itself. And eventually there is a long, winding argument about the advantages of deli meat over cooked meat. Feelings get hurt. But because you are best friends, you will hug it out and pick a winner.</p>
		<p> Perhaps this is why good friends might not want to go into business together. Situations that require utmost objectivity and efficiency sometimes benefit from people who are not as close with one another. There&rsquo;s less backstory getting in the way, less emotion, more opportunity to let the task at hand predominate. I still think it is important to have healthy, friendly relationships with people that are not your BFFs. But perhaps it is better these people are not as close. They occupy more of a niche in your life, are more simplified in your relationship circle, and thus serve more specialized functions. To a degree, you do certain things with them, and that&rsquo;s it. That might be a shame, but I don&rsquo;t really think the human brain has the capacity to be really close to more than a few people. And that&rsquo;s probably a good thing, or else we&rsquo;d all go crazy.</p>
