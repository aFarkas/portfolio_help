		<h1>Spotlight Movie Review</h1>
		<p>Spotlight. Wowser dowser! A movie that could have descended into a dingy, reference library basement full of red herrings, confusing plot details, and scenes of Mark Ruffalo turning page upon page of Catholic Church direcotries. Well, admittedly, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind that part so much.</p>
		<p> But lucky for us viewers, director Tom McCarthy keeps the tension up throughout the movie&mdash;even a scene where Mark Ruffalo visits a government records office has as much tension as the boat scene from Apocalypse Now. Well maybe a more intellectual, journalistic, give me those secret documents or I will proceed to bang my head against the glass until you do type of tension.</p>
		<p> If you are not familiar with the background of Spotlight, here&rsquo;s a glimpse. The movie is set in Boston in 2001, and profiles the Spotlight investigative team of the Boston Globe, and their historic uncovering of the Catholic Church sex abuse scandal in Massachusetts. The movie stars Live Schrieber, Rachel McAdams, Michael Keaton, John Slattery, and Mark Rufallo as a team of roving reporters and editors hwo bring this story from an isolated incident of few priests, to a full-fledged expose of 87 priests in the Boston Catholic Church committing horrific acts of child predation. The new editor of the Globe in the movie, Marty Barron, makes an important point that the only way to pierce the impenetrable public relations machine of the Catholic Church is to highlight that the sex abuse incidents were systemic, tolerated by the highest orders of the Church, and even hushed up by corporate lawyers. Indeed, the ending card of the movie lists subsequent sex abuse investigations around the world, which leads me to believe the Globe succeeded in their goal of exposing this horrible blight.</p>
		<p>I think Ruffalo should snag a Best Supporting Actor nomination for this film. There was one scene in which Matt mentioned between Ruffalo and Keaton, where Ruffalo was passionately pleading his case with Keaton for pushing the story to print sooner rather than later. I think Ruffalo brings a general sense of hurriedness, passion, and tension to the role, which really helped push the script forward.</p>
		<p>This film does an excellent job showing the last days of print journalism, before the locust storm of America Online and the early internet would strip traditional newsrooms bare of their flowering investigative journalism teams. And also, there were some pretty good quotes in the film. Anyway, if you haven&rsquo;t seen Spotlight yet, do it&mdash;one of the best movies of the year.</p>
