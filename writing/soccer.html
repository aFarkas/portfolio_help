		<h1>How To Watch Soccer: For Americans!</h1>
		<p><strong>Dan:</strong> Hey America!</p>
		<p><strong>America:</strong> What?</p>
		<p>Dan: Soccer is the most popular sport in the entire world.</p>
		<p><strong>America</strong>: No..</p>
		<p><strong>Dan:</strong> Yes it is.</p>
		<p><strong>America:</strong> Yeah I knew that, but I didn&rsquo;t want to admit it, because my sports are better than everyone else&rsquo;s.</p>
		<p><strong>Dan:</strong> Well here&rsquo;s the truth: outside of a few Canucks skating across a gridiron and a few games each year in London&rsquo;s Wembley stadium that doesn&rsquo;t even beat reruns of Downton Abbey, no one cares about football.</p>
		<p><strong>Dan:</strong> The world doesn&rsquo;t care <em>so much</em> that they even decided to take the name of our favorite sport and make it the name of their most popular sport! And baseball was eliminated from the Olympics!</p>
		<p><strong>America:</strong> Where were you, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Japan, and South Korea, when we needed you to save our national pastime? Playing hooky in the World Baseball Classic? Pfft!</p>
		<p><strong>America:</strong> Wait a second. Maybe I&rsquo;m the one with the problem.</p>
		<p><strong>Americans have been hating soccer for ages!</strong></p>
		<p>Christopher Columbus brought over many things still popular in the U.S. today--guns, intolerance, rats, and syphyllis&mdash;but soccer was the one thing the American Indians refused to accept! In fact, legend has it that when Columbus presented the Taino Indians with a shiny new soccer ball from Spain, the Chief took the ball and punted it across the woods. This dropkick practice was eventually absorbed into the official rulebook! This is entirely not true.</p>
		<p>What is true is The Laws of the Game were first determined by the International Football Association Board in 1886, a British organization. The French formed their own association in 1904, and in true French fashion, totally submitted to the British rules. The Americans accepted the rules, but they weren&rsquo;t going to let the French boss them around. They reserved the name football for their crazy game involving yards and carries, and adopted the name &ldquo;association&rdquo; to describe the European style of football, but added an &ldquo;-er&rdquo; to the end of it, which is apparently is a thing Brits from Oxford do when they talk. Thus, the word soccer was born.</p>
		<p><strong>The rules of soccer consist as follows:</strong></p>
		<p>Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a&nbsp;captain only one official responsibility as to be involved in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks. That&rsquo;s right America&mdash;the president of the team doesn&rsquo;t even have to do anything. Usually in the U.S. we have to wait until the end of the second term for that to happen.</p>
		<p>Soccer is also unique because all players except the goalkeeper may not use their hands. The field is called the pitch, which really confused Americans because a pitch is usually associated with a ball being thrown, which is banned in soccer, EXCEPT when balls are reintroduced into play.</p>
		<p>There are eight ways to reintroduce a ball into play: the kick-off, throw-in, goal-kick, corner kick, indirect free kick, direct free kick, penalty kick, and dropped ball. In addition to soccer having balls, it also has penal fouls, which is something Americans usually associate with Bill Clinton. If a person gets a yellow card for a penal foul, they are given a warning, and when they get a red card, they are banned from the game. In America, we only have green cards, which I hear are much harder to get than either of those colors.</p>
		<p>Well, there you have it America! I do not really know why soccer hasn&rsquo;t made it here? Maybe it&rsquo;s because we are a nation that likes using our hands and enjoys penal fouls? Or maybe we like our own sports and don&rsquo;t have time for increasingly corrupt European international organizations? Either way, we are a nation with own sports and corrupt organizations, and maybe soccer can be part of that someday.</p>
