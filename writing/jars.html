		<h1>Jars Make Me Upset</h1>
		<p>Jars makes me upset. I&rsquo;m not a freaking pickle in a jar swirling among jelly, vinegar, water and whatever the hell the World Heath Organization wants to call cancerous these days.</p>
		<p>I&rsquo;m a cucumber goddamit, floating in a spring mix salad of real life, shoving my phallic innards into reality&rsquo;s mouth. My head is ripped off in one foul bite, my outsides skinned with a swift swipe of the potato skinner. The cleave of other vegetable&rsquo;s cutting tools. I&rsquo;m not in a jar. I&rsquo;m in the outside world. Writing this incoherent piece of vegetable-inspired gibberish. Taking action among the thousands of other pickles who are locked up in their own viscous, foul-spelling fluids. Among pickles who do not even know they are screwed in their own jars. Among other cucumbers struggling to escape a vegetarian banquet inspired-massacre. The food processor. The knife. The milkshake blender. So many ways to skin a cat. Only one way to procrastinate. To do nothing. To stay in the jar awaiting certain death in a Jewish deli among the multitudes of pastrami and cheek warts. Is this life?</p>
		<p>No, I am death. I am the destroyer of worlds. Electing to trade my slow chemical dill-infused death for a more abstract one involving mayonnaise and multigrain bread. Among other vegetables that try to be as tasty as me but fail to absorb the more delicate tastes of condiments. Mustard seed. Spicy horseradish aioli. Hipster beer IPA backwash. I can do it all. I am but a canvas for the palette to unleash last night&rsquo;s turkey trimmings upon. I am like a mushroom&mdash;no nutritional value, but tons of cuisine possibilities. Throw me in a fryer and bred the crud out of me. Sautee me in a wok and laugh awkwardly as I make a racist Chinese accent. Dice me fine and let me swim backstroke in a hummus spread. Or if you&rsquo;re lazy, slice my insides into circles and throw me in a salad. But please, don&rsquo;t put me in a pickle jar.</p>
		<p>How many garden-variety foods do you know that plead with you not to be pickled? Certainly not the olive. The olive is the biggest canned good slut I&rsquo;ve ever known. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many olives want to cozy up to my brothers and sisters. Shoving our hard, erect bodies against the jar like we&rsquo;re in some kind of chain-whip bondage cooking show. Not even giving us the courtesy of personal space. How would you feel if your head was tied against a safety-seal? Doesn&rsquo;t seem very safe to me.</p>
		<p>And they reek. I grew up in the ground with Johnny C. Bacteria growing myself a second asshole, and I still manage to clean myself after the harvest. The olives grow on a tree. They are air out better than a clothesline hung by an outdoorsy grandma. And yet when Mrs. Olive comes over and says she just wants to be &ldquo;friends&rdquo;, she reeks of Italian&rsquo;s women&rsquo;s toes, dead fish, and whatever the hell goes on in Italy. Is that a way to ensure a delicious pairing in a Caesar salad? Or even a passable pasta sauce? No way in hell. Which is why it&rsquo;s always off to the pickle jar!</p>
		<p>I have to stop. My shrink told me not to blame things on other edible plants. Something about them not having the ability to have conscious thoughts. Sounds like a bunch of PETA bullshit to me. Save the animals, but the plants&mdash;a man&rsquo;s gotta eat something, right? Jeez. I&rsquo;m done for the today. Screw Heinz.</p>
