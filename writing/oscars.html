		<h1>Oscars Update: Visual Effects and Post-Production</h1>
		<p>This year&rsquo;s Oscars nominees boast many impressive visual effects titles. With such CGI-heavy films such as&nbsp;<em>Guardians of the Galaxy,</em>&nbsp;<em>Interstellar, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>X-Men: Days of Future Past</em>, the Academy has quite the slate of impressive visual effects titles to choose from! But how much post-production work really goes into a movie like&nbsp;<em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, a movie entirely based in space but featuring some very personable human talent, such as Chris Pratt?</p>
		<p>The answer is&nbsp;<em>a lot</em>, obviously. But in quantifiable terms, the amount of scenes encoded entirely by computers may even be higher than one might expect. According to Stephane Ceretti, a VFX artist nominated with an Oscar for the film, roughly 90% of the project was based entirely out of visual effects. There were about 2,400 shots in the movie, and nearly 2,200 of them were computer-generated!</p>
		<p>A lot of smart planning in the pre-production stage occurred even before the graphics specialists went to task. Thumbnails, storyboards, and previs were created, which served as a visual blueprint for the film. Next, two primary vendors were selected to handle the majority of the visual effects content. One built the character of Groot, and the other created Rocket (Raccoon!), but the workflow was unique in that each vendor shared their data with the other. Ceretti explains: &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t have one vendor doing all Groot, and another vendor doing all Rocket, because they are almost always in shots together. It would have been way too complicated.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>But even in the CGI realm, other facets of production still relied on more old-fashioned human ability. For example, character movements were entirely hand-drawn by the animators&mdash;the filmmakers elected to forgo all the expensive, clunky equipment associated with on-set performance schedule in favor of relying on their technical teams&rsquo; drawing ability. And of course, the director was still a top-gun (Gunn!) on this feature. James Gunn, who previously worked on CGI flicks like Scooby-Doo and Slither, brought incredible visual ability to this feature. Ceretti explains: &ldquo; James was very prepared. He had co-written the script and he was doing all the thumbnails for the pre-storyboard stuff. He was also excellent when it came to working with previs. James is very precise when it comes to choreographing action; he has a very good visual sense. He really jumped in and became very involved with the visual effects process.&rdquo;</p>
		<p><strong>Visual effects are becoming an integral part of any effective video presentation</strong>, from the smallest local commercial to the largest feature film release. Philadelphia is home to a very talented slate of post-production houses, including&nbsp;<strong>Center City Film and Video</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>SpiritAnimal.tv</strong>, <strong>Springhouse Films</strong>, and<strong>&nbsp;PhillyPost</strong>. You can see Philadelphia-produced visual effects in countless commercials, and shows debuting on channels like Sprout, The History Channel, and Animal Planet. Visual effects artistry is an incredibly challenging vocation, and we celebrate our VFX community for producing such rich, wonderful graphics for our enjoyment. Thank you VFX warriors!</p>
