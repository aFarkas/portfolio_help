		<h1>Happy Sportshanukwansmas 2015!</h1>
		<p>Season&rsquo;s Greetings YouTube and Happy Sportshanukwansmas! My name is Alfonso, the Non-Denominational Sports Elf, and I&rsquo;ve come with presents for your favorite athletes! And because I&rsquo;m non-denominational and thus non-discriminatory, I&rsquo;ve decided to do all the sports! So we better get cracking or else I won&rsquo;t deliver all the gifts in time&hellip;and you know how athletes feel when they don&rsquo;t receive all their gifts. Just ask the players unions.</p>
		<p>First on the list is UFC fighter Jose Aldo. I was having a hard time with this one, because I know lately he isn&rsquo;t one to stick around too long. I decided that the week old potato salad from my refrigerator. The next time McGregor knocks him down, he just take a whiff of this and get right back up! (Sniffs) Very effective.</p>
		<p> My next gift is a chart from Jerry Seinfeld called &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Break the Chain.&rdquo; Basically, Seinfeld would put one X on the chart every day he wrote new comedy material. And you guessed it&mdash;I&rsquo;m this one to the Golden State Warriors. I gave them one of these at the start of the NBA season, and it looked something like this. 24 wins in a row, pretty impressive. I also gave the Philadelphia Sixers one at the start of the season for a different reason.</p>
		<p>Third on my list is &ldquo;professional golfer&rdquo; Paige Spirinac, who just signed an endorsement deal with Instagram. Woops, I mean Calloway. She missed the cut in her professional debut at the Dubai Ladies Masters, finishing 101 out of 107 players. Paige, I am getting you this coupon to my local driving range, complete with an endorsement deal, which is you moving in with me, and me cooking you dinner every night for an entire year. But I must warn you that if you want to take our deal further some day, things might get weird because I still live with my parents.</p>
		<p>I wanted to show off my alchemy skills this holiday season, so I whipped up this healing potion&hellip;and I&rsquo;m giving it to Andy Dalton. Dalton got jurk of the week after he broke this thumb, but the good news is he doesn&rsquo;t have to get surgery and could be back to playoffs. So just drink this potion and things will get better. And don&rsquo;t worry, I didn&rsquo;t put anything bad in it. I&rsquo;m not a Patriots fan.</p>
		<p>Keeping in magical spirits, I just got a copy of Tuck Everlasting, about a boy who struggles with immortality. I&rsquo;m giving it to Roger Federer, who could learn a bit about his own immortality, after he announced that he is extending his tennis career beyond the 2016 Olympics. I have a keyboard, which I&rsquo;m giving to Cardiff goalkeeper Ben Wilson, who was loaned to AFC Wimbledon and then preceded to call his new team&rsquo;s fans a bunch of bad names on twitter. Wilson, please the backspace button next time.</p>
		<p>I&rsquo;ve also a Cuban flag, which I am presenting to MLB players Yasiel Puig, Jose Abreu, Alexie Ramirez, and Brayan Pena, who are making the first Major League Baseball trip to the islands since 1999. Good jobs guys&mdash;Cuba has always been a great baseball country and it&rsquo;s awesome we are going to start seeing more awesome Cuban players.</p>
		<p> And lastly, I have the Koran, which I got for Mr. Donald Trump. Now Trump isn&rsquo;t exactly a sport, but his campaign certainly seems like one. Mr. Trump recently endorsed Pete Rose for the hall of fame after he got snubbed for the MLB Commissioner, while ignoring Muhammad Ali after making disparaging comments about Islam. You&rsquo;re gonna side with Pete Rose, a cheater, over the Greatest of All Time? No wonder you&rsquo;re a crappy candidate.</p>
		<p>And to my joyous reviewers&hellip;I hope you enjoy your Sportshanukwansmas and receive great gifts. And whatever you do, don&rsquo;t poke your eye out!</p>
