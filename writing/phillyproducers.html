		<h1><strong>How Producers Can Help You Create Better Music</strong></h1>
<h3><em>Faith Restored - Words from Studio Owners</em></h3>
		<p>Jason Dunkerly knows that Philadelphia artists have something to say&mdash;it&rsquo;s just often hard to break through the status quo to deliver true musical originality. Dunkerly, the owner of Philadelphia&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.drowningfishstudio.com/" target="_blank">Drowning Fish Studio</a>, has worked with artists for many years to move past the generic musical norms that are present in their repertoire. Dunkerly explains that musicians are often prone to landing in what he terms &ldquo;comfort zones&rdquo;&mdash;presentations of their music that feel rehearsed and professional, but lack the innovation that characterizes truly creative expression.</p>
		<p> &ldquo;The majority of Philadelphia artists are inspired,&rdquo; Dunkerly explains. &ldquo;But it is the job of the recording studio to break through the shell of the artists, to get them to fully integrate their emotion and to dig deep into their core, and find more of themselves.&rdquo; This is what makes Dunkerly such an effective producer in-studio; while his production facility has a reputation as a professional recording environment, Jason is also renowned for his ability to challenge artists and obtain truly inventive music output. Dunkerly calls this inspired musical production the &ldquo;feel music&rdquo;&mdash;something that can only be achieved when the artist leaves his previous comfort zone, and enters a new one that is riskier and strays more from established tradition.</p>
		<p> But with the advent of digital audio and bedroom recording, many fledging musicians are mixing and recording themselves. Is hiring a producer really integral to a good recording? Expert producer Bruce Kapham says yes. He explains on his blog <em>Delicious Audio </em>that good producers often possess intrinsic knowledge of the components that make a good recording. Kapham writes, &ldquo;[A good producer] is someone who can see the big picture, and knows how to capture the best performances - someone who has a musical vision that matches the band&rsquo;s!&rdquo; Even if a member of the band possesses recording knowledge, it can often be helpful to bring in an outside member versed in similar musical stylings who can bring an expert, yet objective opinion to the band&rsquo;s creative output. And a producer also preserves a band&rsquo;s &lsquo;democratic equilibrium&rsquo; - instead of one member wearing multiple hats, bandmates can concentrate on what they do best - playing great music!</p>
		<p>Dunkerly is very excited to support Philly producers, as a part of RECphilly, where he will develop new Philly talent. &ldquo;We need leadership musically, to bring substance back to music,&rdquo; Dunkerly concludes. &ldquo;RECphilly has the power to bring back feel music&mdash;music that has meaning behind it.&rdquo;</p>
