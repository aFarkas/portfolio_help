		<h1>What Does It&rsquo;s Not Personal Mean?</h1>
		<p>The thing about getting older is that sometimes I get introduced to social norms, particularly passive-aggressive social norms of Western culture, that I don&rsquo;t like. These social norms have always obviously followed me around, as if my 23-years could even dare to bring down thousands of years of people treating each other a certain way! I&rsquo;m so misguided!</p>
		<p> Kidding. Well, I&rsquo;m not kidding how strongly I feel about what is apparently considered &ldquo;normal&rdquo; by standards of human interaction. By far the thing that bothers me the most is when someone doesn&rsquo;t respond to me.</p>
		<p> It&rsquo;s worse than a no, a rejection, even a fart in the face. There&rsquo;s literally no feedback&mdash;there&rsquo;s no way to know I did something wrong, what the timeline is, or if there is even a relationship to begin with.</p>
		<p> This is something that I&rsquo;ve explored diligently before putting this down on this piece of digital paper. I&rsquo;ve asked many people&rsquo;s opinions, including Google&rsquo;s. And the one common response is one that I think would be similar to one someone would make after particularly bad sex.</p>
		<p> <em>It&rsquo;s not personal.</em> Never have three words caused so much confusion in my life while rejecting the opportunity of an easily packaged, analyzable reason why something occurred.</p>
		<p> Ok, for one, what does the word &ldquo;personal&rdquo; actually mean in this instance? To me, something personal is a meaningful attempt to get at the core of an individual&rsquo;s psyche. If I bought you a birthday cake, and tied a picture of your elbow to each candle, with each picture being chronologically dating to a year in your life, now that would be personal.</p>
		<p> So I supposed <em>It&rsquo;s not personal</em> might mean something like, &ldquo;Oh, they are just too busy. Or lazy. Or they don&rsquo;t prioritize you. Or they don&rsquo;t care about you.&rdquo;</p>
		<p> Sometimes I do believe this. I think that people generally think about themselves the most, and do not save enough room in the altruism bin for strangers, because they somehow mean &ldquo;less&rdquo; to them. This is entirely logical&mdash;it makes total sense, both from an evolutionary and emotional perspective, for human beings to invest in people they know well. Other people must get pushed to the side, because there&rsquo;s not enough emotional capital for a person to care about <em>everyone</em>. This is an argument that makes sense to me.</p>
		<p> What stops making sense is when the line between <em>It&rsquo;s not personal </em>and <em>I&rsquo;m purposefully ignoring you, because I don&rsquo;t want to respond</em> becomes blurry. If I make it really easy to someone to respond to me&mdash;reaching out them constantly, even requiring just a one-word answer to satisfy my response&mdash;there&rsquo;s really no excuse for a person not being able to answer. The whole <em>It&rsquo;s not personal</em> argument breaks down, because if it wasn&rsquo;t personal they would just take a second to respond. Sometimes I feel like people ignore me for slightly more meditated reasons: they don&rsquo;t want to deal with me, don&rsquo;t want to talk to me, or don&rsquo;t want to start a conflict with me. I would argue that these reasons <em>are personal</em>. That&rsquo;s what makes it so hard for me&mdash;it&rsquo;s hard to tell when someone just forgot, and when they actually are making the conscious act of not talking to me. In this age of Internet communication with long breaks in between messages, this makes it very hard for me to understand other people.</p>
		<p> Still&mdash;most people I talk to are of the <em>It&rsquo;s not personal </em>camp. And they are probably true, most of the time. But I still think there is a minority of cases in what I call the <em>I don&rsquo;t want to deal with you </em>camp, something that is increasingly easy to be a part of. It&rsquo;s easier for someone not to respond than deal with the consequences of rejection or a negative answer. But for me, not-responding is a cop-out, and makes me feel a lot worse than outright rejection, because I never get any feedback.</p>
		<p> I&rsquo;ve accepted I can&rsquo;t change other people. I almost always get back to people, because I know how shitty it feels when people don&rsquo;t get back to me. And if I don&rsquo;t get back to someone, they&rsquo;ve had to do something pretty terrible. I guess I&rsquo;m just a different person, and I shouldn&rsquo;t push my values on others. I guess the hard part is that I thought everyone else felt this way.</p>
