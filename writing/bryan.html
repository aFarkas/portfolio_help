		<h1>Bryan the Cloud Dweller</h1>
		<p>Bryan is one of those people who does not know how he got into his life situation. Which is to say he is like most human beings. But what is unique about Bryan is that he is somewhere most people are not.</p>
		<p>Bryan was not really happy with his life on the ground. It was just too green, too terrestrial, too hilly. His unconsciously had to deal with the fact that his feet were exerting hundreds of pounds of gravity upon the ground every second, while the earth was rotating at a speed faster than most Ferraris can go. Most people are not attuned to this fact however, except maybe seagulls, Magellan, and vertigo suffers. And Bryan didn&rsquo;t really notice it, either. It just pissed him off that he had to be a part the whole dang thing.</p>
		<p>So one day, before he went to his firmly rooted down bed, he wished he could get away from it all. He wished that the laws of gravity did not apply to him&mdash;for once, he could be an exception to physics. He wished that his burly calf muscles did not have to support his beer gut against the rock hard earth of our little blue marble. And lastly, and perhaps most importantly, he wished you he could be alone.</p>
		<p>Bryan woke up the next morning and poured his Special K. He watched the Mets recap, pretended not to notice the souring of his cereal, and shat something that approximated a comic book villain. He didn&rsquo;t want to open his door to start his routine, because everyone knows that getting let down first thing in the morning pretty much screws up the whole day. So he opened his door after he wiped his butt. But not after washing his hands. He wanted to fit it in right between the two, because they usually go together like peanut butter and jelly. Bryan wanted to stick it to the man this morning. He was, after all, leaving Earth.</p>
		<p>Bryan opens his door. It&rsquo;s good thing he didn&rsquo;t step out, because there was basically a layer of magma encrusting the entire underbelly of his basement, which was firmly implanted in molten rock. The edge of his basement, where he kept his Fender Stratocasters and the stair-stepper, was pretty much burnt to a crisp. The rest of the mess&mdash;which was just that, a mess&mdash;had a medium-well complexion to it, like a hamburger left unattended. But Bryan didn&rsquo;t care&mdash;he had no preference for his meat, anyway. He was just happy he was finally alone.</p>
		<p>But not exactly how he invisioned, after all. He imagined himself shedding a few pounds, maybe flapping with the birdies, eating some devils-food cake and not having to deal with the consequences of a poop that would PLUNGE into the toilet. (Though it&rsquo;s probably crueler to speculate how Bryan would dispose of his waste of his home was in a large pool of water vapor in the atmosphere, with no where to go but down.) Instead, he guessed that if he stepped on a scale, he would probably break the arrow mechanism. But it wasn&rsquo;t just him. At least the house came in the deal, too. And it wasn&rsquo;t as if he felt any heavier, because everything around him weighed eighteen times as much. So it really was no different than before. Except now he was living in a subterranean carbon monoxide-filled dungeon.</p>
		<p>The only thing truly different for Bryan was that he was now finally alone. But pretty soon, he got used to everything again. The weight of the place, the fumes, the routine was no different than when he was walking on grass and whizzing on top of the Earth. So he thought of what he originally wanted, a life in the clouds, and imagined that would turn out the same way too. So finally Bryan gave up, and finally learned to be content. And soon, he learned he could be wherever he wanted to be.</p>
