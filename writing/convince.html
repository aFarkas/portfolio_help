		<h1>How To (Not) Convince Someone To Do Anything</h1>
		<p>If you are like me, you are a very shy person who loves being true to himself at all costs. To other people, this can get annoying very fast.</p>
		<p> For example, many of friends in college loved to play poker at my apartment. Unfortunately, I have always hated poker and probably always will. I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s because the game is mostly about deception and taking money from other people (although I&rsquo;m sure others will disagree), but it just doesn&rsquo;t seem like something that is as fun as creating or writing. But it&rsquo;s a great way to lose money and get sloshed while doing it, which can be fun once in a while, as long as you&rsquo;re not poor like most people.</p>
		<p> Anyway, because I hated poker, I would always lock myself in my room with my guitar and lame early-period R.E.M. records. I&rsquo;d lie in my bed and and wait until someone interested enough in the awful guitar music emanating from my room would come in my room. However, it was almost nearly always late, so the conversation was very short and not worth much. I&rsquo;d also fall asleep in between sentences.</p>
		<p> Ok&mdash;so how is this related to convincing people? Well, I think this example is a good presentation of how <em>not </em>to convince someone. For one, I was alone all the time and not very much part of the group camaraderie. On the one hand, I preserved my personal integrity by not playing poker, but on the other hand, I was lonely and stuck with a terrible R.E.M. record for three hours. And no one was really sympathetic to my cause because I brought all this upon myself.</p>
		<p> So maybe the way to convince people to do anything is to get out of your comfort zone and join them in something. I&rsquo;m not saying to abandon all ye&rsquo; morals and start dressing in togas to impress people, but maybe, even if it&rsquo;s just for a short period, show you are capable of doing something that isn&rsquo;t exactly your forte. Then, when the time comes for you to ask others to do something you very much enjoy, perhaps they will join you. I don&rsquo;t know if this idea works every time, but I do know that, in theory, joining in something that others are passionate about will show them that you care.</p>
		<p> I&rsquo;m still not convinced that reciprocity is universal&mdash;I&rsquo;ve helped people plenty of times that didn&rsquo;t really do anything in return. I&rsquo;m not sure why&mdash;probably because they didn&rsquo;t know how, I didn&rsquo;t make it clear to them what I wanted, or possibly because they were ignorant and wrapped up in their own affairs. But I&rsquo;d like to believe at least some of the time that helping others pays off.</p>
		<p>P.S. Early R.E.M. is good, although when I wrote this I hated it.</p>
